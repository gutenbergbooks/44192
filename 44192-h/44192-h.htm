  much has already been said and written, both wisely and well, upon the marvellous edifice which
  has just been reared with such magical rapidity to enshrine the results of the skill and industry
  of all nations, that it would appear an almost hopeless task to present the subject in any new
  point of view to the reader.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, the authors cannot lay claim to novelty or originality in the execution of the
  pleasurable work which they have undertaken, they are not without hopes that, from their having
  been connected with this gigantic undertaking during the greater part of its progress, they will
  be enabled to trace in a more detailed and consecutive manner than has yet been attempted the
  history of the design and execution of the building up to the period of its completion.</p>

  <p>A great deal has been lately said upon the want of distinctive character in almost all the
  buildings of the present day; and it is certainly a striking fact that in scarcely any of our
  important modern structures does the exterior appearance in any way lead the spectator to form an
  idea of the purposes or arrangement of the interior, the former being apparently governed by
  fancy, or the fashion for some particular style, while the latter only, is accommodated to the
  peculiar requirements of the case. Thus we have porticos which do not shelter from the weather, or
  in which no one is allowed to walk; Venetian palaces appear piled upon a substructure of
  plate-glass; baronial castles prove to be model prisons; and richly-decorated mansions, from the
  time of "Good Queen Bess," or fanciful Italian villas, are made to serve for the accommodation of
  paupers.</p>

  <p>The ancients appear to have been more careful in this respect, so that the form and external
  arrangement afforded in most cases a ready key to the purposes of their structures. Their temples,
  their fora, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, and other public edifices, seem each to have been
  stamped with their own characteristic features, at the same time without in any way producing a
  monotonous uniformity among the different examples of the same class of building.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page2">{2}</span></div>

  <p>Now, if this criterion of excellence be applied to the remarkable building recently erected in
  Hyde Park, it will be found that the constructive arrangement of the interior is plainly expressed
  without, and it must be conceded that it possesses at least those elements of beauty arising from
  consistency and simplicity which, in combination with its vast size, give it also that of
  grandeur. That it is faultless it would be needless to assert, or to imagine that, from its
  example, a new style of architecture will originate; but that it is admirably suited to its
  purpose, that it is a remarkable specimen of the constructive skill of this country, and that it
  will certainly form one of the most interesting objects of the Great Exhibition by which it has
  been called into being, if not the most interesting of all, must, we think, be admitted by all
  candid observers.</p>

  <p>Although the building in its present form was designed, as well as carried out, in a singularly
  short space of time, this could not have been accomplished but for the great amount of thought and
  labour which had been previously bestowed upon the subject. In order, therefore, to trace the
  whole of the progress of the design, it will be necessary briefly to advert to the early labours
  bestowed upon the project.</p>

  <p>On the 5th of January, 1850, the Royal Commission for carrying out this great scheme was
  gazetted; its first and second meetings, which were respectively held on the 11th and 18th of the
  same month, were entirely devoted to preliminary arrangements, and determining the mode of
  conducting its proceedings.</p>

  <p>Among the most urgent matters calling for the attention of the Commissioners, the subject of
  the building early presented itself, as it was of the utmost importance that the longest possible
  time should be allowed for its erection; and, accordingly, at the third meeting, held on the 24th
  of January, the following noblemen and gentlemen were appointed to act as a</p>

  <p><img src="images/initial_t.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="T"/>HE
  first point to be ascertained by this Committee was where to find an eligible site; for although
  they were not able at that early stage of their labours to determine the exact amount of space
  that would be required, they appear to have been of opinion that, from the general data before
  them, about sixteen acres would be necessary&mdash;an amount which has been subsequently
  considerably exceeded, but which was already an enormous area to be covered by one building; and
  in dealing with it the Committee must have felt that a very heavy amount of responsibility rested
  upon them, as appears, indeed, from their recommendation to the Royal Commission given below.</p>

  <p>After about a month of attentive deliberation, the Committee made a report upon this part of
  their labours.</p>

  <p>With regard to the site, it had appeared to the Committee that&mdash;firstly, the north-eastern
  portion of Hyde Park; secondly, the long space between her Majesty's private road and the
  Kensington road, in the southern part of Hyde Park; and thirdly, the north-western portion of
  Regent's Park, were the only available spaces about the metropolis which would afford the
  necessary accommodation; and it was believed that the order in which they were named represented
  also their relative eligibility. As regarded the first, the Committee had been informed by the
  Chief Commissioner of her Majesty's Woods and Forests that considerable objections would arise to
  its occupation for such a purpose, and that no such objections would be raised to the use of the
  second; and the Committee, therefore, recommended the adoption of this site, which, amongst other
  advantages, is remarkable for the facility of access afforded by the existing roads.</p>

  <p>As regarded the extent of the building, the Committee were not yet in possession of sufficient
  data to enable them to determine this accurately, but, from such information as they had before
  them, they thought that it might be assumed, for the present, that about sixteen acres of covered
  space would be required.</p>

  <p>And finally, as regarded the mode of proceeding to determine the general interior arrangements
  or ground-plan of the building, a subject to which they had given much consideration, they
  resolved, "That, in their opinion, it was desirable to seek, by public competition, for
  suggestions as to the general arrangements of the ground-plan of the building."</p>

  <p>It was deemed by the Committee that the peculiar object for which the building was required,
  namely, the encouragement of the widest and most liberal competition in all the branches of arts
  and manufactures&mdash;the circumstance of the cost of the erection being defrayed by the
  public&mdash;the <span class="pagenum" id="page4">{4}</span>peculiar character of the building,
  for the designing of which were especially required judgment and contrivance in the detail of
  arrangement, and experience in the management of large crowds, and for the construction of which
  the mechanical skill and knowledge of the application and of the economical use of materials now
  so generally possessed by builders and practical men were necessary&mdash;all seemed, in the
  opinion of the Committee, to be reasons for recommending that the designs for the general
  arrangements should, as far as practicable, be the result of public competition, and that the
  actual construction should be so to the fullest extent. The Committee were, moreover, of opinion
  that the general design or arrangement of such a building was one of those subjects, perhaps few
  in number, on which many good ideas may be elicited by a general contribution of plans; and that a
  mode might be adopted of obtaining such plans, and collecting useful suggestions from them, which
  should not eventually lead to any loss of time, or be attended with those delays which too
  frequently render ordinary competition inconvenient.</p>

  <p>Great objections were made in some quarters to the proposed site in Hyde Park; but as they were
  not raised on really public grounds, they were gradually overcome by the interest which the public
  at large manifested in the success of the undertaking.</p>

  <p>In consequence of the latter recommendation in the Report which was adopted by the Royal
  Commissioners, the following document was published by them on March 13th, 1850, copies of which
  appear to have found their way into almost every corner of Europe<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The Committee appointed by the Royal Commission to advise on 'all matters relating to the
  building,' having received the sanction of the Commission, are desirous of obtaining from all
  parties who are disposed to assist them suggestions for the general arrangement of the buildings
  and premises required for this Exhibition. Upon the general form of the building in plan, the
  distribution of its parts, the mode of access, and the internal arrangements and contrivances,
  will depend the convenience and general fitness of such a building; and it is upon these points
  that the Committee seek information and suggestions, and wish to encourage the most extended
  competition in the preparation of plans. The Committee do not propose to offer any pecuniary
  reward for such plans&mdash;they rely upon the desire which men of all countries will feel to
  forward the objects of the proposed Exhibition. The Committee think it probable that, when the
  plans are received, they may not be limited to the selection of any one plan, but may derive
  useful ideas from many; and that the best plan may be determined upon by the help of this general
  assistance. As the credit of any such plan will be due solely to the contributors, the Committee
  propose to make a report, in which they will acknowledge by name those whose plans had been wholly
  or partially adopted, or who had afforded the most useful <span class="pagenum"
  id="page5">{5}</span>suggestions; and the Committee hope to be able to offer such other honorary
  distinction to the successful contributors as the circumstances may appear to warrant. In order to
  guide the contributors in the preparation of such plans and designs, and to facilitate the
  examination and the comparison of them when received, the Committee have enumerated concisely the
  principal 'desiderata' for such a building, and have laid down certain rules and conditions to
  which they earnestly request the contributors to conform, as the Committee will be under the
  necessity of abiding strictly by the regulation of not acknowledging any plans which may be sent
  in a form inconsistent with these rules. Copies of the engraved plan of the ground referred to may
  be had on application to the secretaries of the Commission, at the New Palace at Westminster."</p>

  <p>An engraved plan of the site which had been fixed upon, together with the subjoined
  regulations, which all competitors would be expected to observe, were subsequently issued to all
  applicants<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"1. The communications from contributors must consist of a single sheet of paper, not larger
  than the accompanying engraving, with a simple ground-plan upon a scale of 1·1000 of the full
  size, with such elevations and sections only of the building, and on the same sheet, as may be
  necessary to elucidate the system proposed&mdash;such elevations and sections not being intended
  to convey more than a general idea of the building, and not entering into details of construction
  or of architectural decoration&mdash;to be accompanied by a short, clear-written explanation of
  the system recommended, on a separate sheet. Any contributor wishing to send two designs must send
  separate and distinct communications, each conforming to the above conditions. No communications
  made inconsistent with these conditions, or any plan prepared upon a different scale from that
  prescribed, can be received. The plans, &amp;c., must be sent on or before the 8th of April next,
  addressed to the Secretaries of the Exhibition, New Palace at Westminster, London. It is suggested
  that the most convenient mode of preparing the plan, elevation, and section, would be to draw them
  upon one of the engraved copies of the plan of the ground which accompany these
  instructions.&mdash;2. The building is to be erected on the space marked A B C D, and must not
  extend beyond the boundaries of the shaded portion. The groups of trees shown on the plan must be
  preserved. The principal public approaches are by the roads E F and G H. The road K L will be
  available only for foot-passengers. There will be no objection to the formation of cross-roads
  between the two last, G H and K L, if the design of the building requires it.&mdash;3. The roofed
  portion of the building is to cover a space of 700,000 square feet, or about 65,000 square metres;
  and the whole building must not occupy, including open spaces, an area of more than 900,000 square
  feet, or about 84,000 square metres. The building generally will be of one storey only.&mdash;4.
  No space will be <span class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span>required for cattle, or for shrubs or
  flowers.&mdash;5. It may be assumed, so far as it affects the ground-plan, that the light will be
  obtained entirely from the roof, and the building will be constructed of fire-proof materials.</p>

  <p class="sp5">"The general requirements are&mdash;simplicity of arrangement; economy of space;
  capability of extending or curtailing the building without destroying its symmetry as a whole, or
  interfering with the general arrangement, it being impossible to determine the exact extent of
  roof required until a late period of construction. Adaptation for the erection of separate
  portions of the building at different periods. Conveniences of ingress and egress, with facilities
  of access to all parts of the Exhibition, either from the exterior or interior. Means of
  classification of the various objects of different departments. Wall-space for the display of
  articles requiring it. Means of affording private access and accommodation for exhibitors, with
  counting-houses, if required. Committee-rooms, council-rooms, public refreshment-rooms, and all
  other public and private accommodation. (This portion of the building may be in two or more
  storeys if required.) Internal arrangements, by which, under proper regulations, large crowds of
  visitors may circulate freely, and have convenient access to all parts of the Exhibition, and
  uninterrupted means of examining the various objects exhibited."</p>

  alt="T"/>HOUGH the time allowed for the preparation of drawings was but short, being only about
  one month, no less than 233 designs were sent in, many of them of an elaborate architectural
  character. Of these, thirty-eight, or one-sixth of the whole, were received from the different
  foreign countries of Europe (France, twenty-seven; Belgium, two; Holland, three; Hanover, one;
  Naples, one; Switzerland, two; Rhine Prussia, one; Hamburgh, one); 138, or more than half the
  entire number, from London and its vicinity, where the interest excited was naturally more
  immediate; fifty-one from the provincial towns of England; six from Scotland, and three from
  Ireland. Seven were sent anonymously. The small number contributed by the sister kingdoms seems
  rather remarkable.</p>

  <p>The greater part of these designs were, of course, contributed by members of the architectural
  and engineering professions, but some were the productions of amateurs, and one among them
  purported to be the suggestion of a lady. Here, then, was matter enough not only to assist, but
  even, from its great variety, to perplex the Committee, since at once every possible variety of
  style in decoration, material in construction, and system in arrangement, were strenuously
  recommended by the authors of the respective designs as the great ultimatum sought for.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page7">{7}</span></div>

  <p>To Mr. Digby Wyatt, whose services were to a great extent withdrawn from the Executive
  Committee, in order that his professional knowledge of the subject might be placed at the disposal
  of the Building Committee, was intrusted the arduous task of examining and classifying these
  incongruous materials, and of eliminating from them such general principles of arrangement as
  seemed most worthy of the attentive consideration of the Committee. The result of this gentleman's
  minute examination was embodied in a Report, upon the basis of the recommendations contained in
  which the subsequent utilitarian portions of the design of the Building Committee would appear to
  have been founded.</p>

  <p>After holding about fifteen protracted sittings, the Committee presented the following Report
  to the Royal Commission on the 9th of May<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  </div>


  <p class="ac">"<i>My Lords and Gentlemen</i>,</p>

  <p>"We have the honour to report that we have examined the numerous plans so liberally contributed
  by native and foreign architects in accordance with the public invitation.</p>

  <p>"Exhausting in their numerous projects and suggestions almost every conceivable variety of
  building, the authors of those designs have materially assisted us in arriving at the conclusions
  which we have now the honour to report.</p>

  <p>"We have been aided in our analysis of this subject by a great amount of thought and
  elaboration thus brought to bear upon it from various points of view.</p>

  <p>"We have, however, arrived at the unanimous conclusion, that able and admirable as many of
  these designs appeared to be, there was yet no single one so accordant with the peculiar objects
  in view, either in the principle or detail of its arrangements, as to warrant us in recommending
  it for adoption.</p>

  <p>"In some of the least successful of the designs submitted, we find indicated errors and
  difficulties to be avoided, whilst in the abler and more practicable of them, there are valuable
  conceptions and suggestions which have greatly assisted us in framing the plan we have now the
  honour to lay before you. In preparing this design we have been governed mainly by three
  considerations<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"1. The provisional nature of the building.</p>

  <p>"2. The advisability of constructing it as far as possible in such a form as to be available,
  with the least sacrifice of labour and material, for other purposes, as soon as its original one
  shall have been fulfilled, thus insuring a minimum ultimate cost.</p>

  <p>"3. Extreme simplicity, demanded by the short time in which the work must be completed.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page8">{8}</span></div>

  <p>"For the arrangements of the plan we rely for effect on honesty of construction, vastness of
  dimension, and fitness of each part to its end.</p>

  <p>"The principal points of excellence we have endeavoured to attain are&mdash;</p>

  <p>"1. Economy of construction.</p>

  <p>"2. Facilities for the reception, classification, and display of goods.</p>

  <p>"3. Facilities for the circulation of visitors.</p>

  <p>"4. Arrangement for grand points of view.</p>

  <p>"5. Centralisation of supervision.</p>

  <p>"6. Some striking feature to exemplify the present state of the science of construction in this
  country.</p>

  <p>"The first of these, <span class="smaller">ECONOMY</span>, is attained by doing away with any
  internal walls (all divisions being made by the necessary stalls), by reducing the whole
  construction, with the exception of the dome, to cast iron columns, supporting the lightest form
  of iron roof in long unbroken lines, and by the whole of the work being done in the simplest
  manner, and adapted in all respects to serve hereafter for other purposes.</p>

  <p>"The second, facilities for the <span class="smaller">RECEPTION</span>, <span
  class="smaller">CLASSIFICATION</span>, and <span class="smaller">DISPLAY</span> of goods. The main
  central entrance for the reception of objects for exhibition will probably be that most
  approachable from the public road. All cases accompanying goods will be examined, registered,
  catalogued, &amp;c., in the offices of the Executive; the packing-cases will then be put upon a
  truck running on a line of rails laid down temporarily, and conveyed to the centre turn-table,
  from which they may be carried by a line of rails at right angles to the first, to the end of the
  transverse gallery, in which they may be destined to be placed.</p>

  <p>"The most important condition to insure successful <i>classification</i> is, that those to whom
  the duty of arrangement may be confided should be hampered by no fixed limits of space, such as
  would have been the case had the building been divided into a number of halls, sections, or
  chambers. The plan submitted fulfils this condition perfectly; as objects can be arranged just as
  they are received, and moved, if necessary, from gallery to gallery with great facility.</p>

  <p>"The successful display of the goods would be best insured by leaving, under certain general
  restrictions, the fitting up of each stall to the Exhibitor or his Agent, floor-space only being
  allotted to each; and stands, frames, brackets, shelves, &amp;c., being put up by a contractor's
  carpenter, at a fixed tariff.</p>

  <p>"The best light is provided, and the most economical wall-space is proposed to be furnished by
  connecting pillar to pillar transversely, on the extreme north and south sides of the building, by
  rods, from which draperies, &amp;c., can be suspended.</p>

  <p>"The third, <span class="smaller">FACILITIES FOR THE CIRCULATION OF VISITORS</span>, is thus
  attained. The visitor, on arrival at the central hall, proceeds at choice to any one <span
  class="pagenum" id="page9">{9}</span>of the four sections. He will, most probably, desire either
  to follow the whole course of the section selected, or will wish to go at once to some particular
  class or object. He will be enabled to do either the one or the other, without interfering with
  the general current, by means of gates or other arrangements, which shall insure the current of
  visitors passing in one direction. If he desire to proceed rapidly from one end of the building to
  the other, and finds the great central gangway at all blocked up, he will, no doubt, be able to
  get on by either the north or south corridors, fifteen feet wide. Numerous doors of egress in
  these latter afford ready means of exit for a large number of persons. Seats are provided in the
  middle of the great central gangway for those who may desire to rest.</p>

  <p>"The fourth, <span class="smaller">ARRANGEMENT FOR GRAND POINTS OF VIEW</span>. The view from
  or to the centre of the building will, from its extent, be necessarily imposing. The seats and
  main avenues are arranged so that, on the occasion of the distribution of the prizes, an immense
  number of persons may be accommodated. Most interesting views might be obtained from galleries
  constructed at either end of the building and around the dome, for the admission of the public to
  which some small charge might be made.</p>

  <p>"The fifth, <span class="smaller">CENTRALISATION OF SUPERVISION</span>. All the business of the
  Exhibition will be carried on in one spot, and be readily under control. The Royal Commission, the
  principal Committees, Clerks, Accountants, Police, &amp;c., would be together, and in so large an
  establishment it would be absolutely necessary, or much time would be wasted in walking from one
  point to another. Passages running behind the money-takers' boxes, with glazed doors into them,
  would enable each accountant to detect anything improper that might be going on, and to exchange
  and balance checks, money, &amp;c., at any moment. Telegraphic communication with each of the four
  pay-places will permit orders to be given, cash accounts, &amp;c., to be issued and returned, from
  and to the head-accountant's office, as often as may be necessary.</p>

  <p>"Four Committee-rooms, one for a Jury in each section, have been provided at the extreme east
  and west ends. The duties of such Committees being deliberative, and not executive, it is not
  necessary that they should be accommodated in the Central Establishment, where they would be more
  liable to be disturbed than at the extremity of the building.</p>

  <p>"A policeman stationed in each gallery would, from his elevated position, be enabled to observe
  much which might escape detection if he mingled only with the crowd.</p>

  <p>"The sixth, <span class="smaller">SOME STRIKING FEATURE TO EXEMPLIFY THE PRESENT STATE OF THE
  SCIENCE OF CONSTRUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY</span>. In order that the building, in which England
  invites the whole world to display their richest productions, may afford, at least in one point, a
  grandeur not incommensurate with the occasion, we propose, by a dome of light sheet iron 200 feet
  <span class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}</span>in diameter, to produce an effect at once striking
  and admirable. From calculations which have been made of the cost of so grand a Hall, we have
  reason to expect that it may be executed for a sum not greatly exceeding the cost of the simplest
  form of roof likely to be adopted to cover the same area.</p>

  <p>"It is to be borne in mind that a considerable amount of any such difference may be recovered,
  should this portion of the building be converted hereafter to other purposes, which is more than
  probable. This vast dome it is proposed to light mainly from one circle of light in its centre,
  and thus the sculpture will be pleasingly and suitably lit.</p>

  <p>"Six out of the eight openings in the cylinder of the dome would be well adapted for the
  exhibition of stained glass windows of great extent, while the two remaining arches will open to
  the main central gallery. The lower part of some of the voids will admit the eye to turf and
  shrubs, and produce a great freshness of effect.</p>

  <p>"The immense continuity of the Central Avenue will be broken and relieved by a variation in the
  roof opposite the openings to the second and third sets of refreshment-rooms, and windows for the
  reception of Stained Glass may be placed at the ends of each transverse gallery, thus terminating
  the vista for each.</p>

  <p>"It now only remains to explain the course of action we would recommend for adoption as soon as
  the principles of the plan, &amp;c., shall be positively decided.</p>

  <p>"We consider this to be an occasion upon which the greatest amount of intellectual and
  commercial ingenuity and ability should be called out; and that a generous rivalry among those
  best fitted to execute the principal portions of this vast structure may lead to results which no
  amount of detailed study that we could possibly give to this matter would supply.</p>

  <p>"We would therefore recommend that every advantage should be taken of the accumulated and
  experimental knowledge and resources of intelligent and enterprising contractors, and that every
  opportunity should be afforded to them of <span class="smaller">DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES</span>.
  We would therefore recommend as the best means of enlisting their services the following course of
  action:</p>

  <p>"Adopting the approved design as a basis, we would proceed immediately to prepare such
  working-drawings and specifications as may be necessary, and to issue invitations for tenders to
  execute Works in accordance with them, requesting from competitors, in addition, such suggestions

  <p>The following Report of the Committee on the competition plans submitted, and which was so
  unfavourably received by the public, and more <span class="pagenum"
  id="page11">{11}</span>particularly by the profession, was presented to the Royal Commission on
  the 16th of May<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  </div>


  <p class="ac">"<i>My Lords and Gentlemen</i>,</p>

  <p>"Your Committee beg leave to report, that the invitation issued by the Commissioners,
  requesting information and suggestions for the general arrangement of the Building and premises
  required for the Exhibition of 1851, has been responded to in the most ample and satisfactory
  manner, both as respects the variety of useful ideas presented to their consideration, and the
  liberality with which many experienced and skilful men of foreign countries, no less than of our
  own, have contributed their valuable time to this great undertaking, thereby evincing their entire
  sympathy both with the great cause of Arts and Industry in which her Majesty's Commissioners have
  embarked, and with the arduous labours of the Directors of the undertaking.</p>

  <p>"The Designs and Specifications transmitted to the Committee amount to the surprising number of
  233, offering an aggregate of professional sacrifice of very considerable importance; for, not
  confining themselves to suggestions only, which were invited by the Programme, a large proportion
  of them are remarkable for elaboration of thought and elegance of execution.</p>

  <p>"Penetrated with admiration and respect for these gratuitous and valuable contributions,
  unexampled, they believe, in the history of competition, your Committee have devoted the most
  careful attention to the collection of these projects, and hasten to offer those acknowledgments
  which are due to their merits, and to the generous motives which have led to their execution; and
  they trust that the public may shortly be witnesses of the effect of this very noble emulation of
  the skill of all countries, by the public exhibition of these designs, offering the opportunity,
  in the true spirit of the whole undertaking, of mutual improvement, respect, and friendship
  amongst the cultivators of the liberal arts in the several countries of Europe.</p>

  <p>"It is remarkable that, while many of these contributions may be attributed to the laudable
  motive of professional reputation and advancement on the part of practitioners not yet
  sufficiently known to the public, a great number are from Gentlemen whose position in the
  confidence of their respective Governments or in the Republic of Arts and Letters is of the
  highest eminence, and who can have been actuated by no such personal motives. Already entitled to
  respect and admiration, they could have little to gain, while they have something to lose, in the
  competition for glory. The kind and frank communication, therefore, of their thoughts and <span
  class="pagenum" id="page12">{12}</span>experience towards this great work is to be the more highly
  commended. Every possible mode of accomplishing the object in view has been displayed by the
  respective contributors as regards economy of structure and distribution, and these qualities are
  united with various degrees of architectural symmetry and features in many designs. Our
  illustrious continental neighbours have especially distinguished themselves by compositions of the
  utmost taste and learning, worthy of enduring execution&mdash;examples of what might be done in
  the architectural illustration of the subject, when viewed in its highest aspect, and, at all
  events, exhibiting features of grandeur, arrangement, and grace which your Committee have not
  failed to appreciate.</p>

  <p>"Amongst these several classes of design, the practical character of our own countrymen, as
  might have been expected, has been remarkably illustrated in some very striking and simple methods
  suited to the temporary purposes of the Building, due attention having been paid to the pecuniary
  means allotted to this part of the undertaking. The principle of suspension has been applied in a
  single tent of iron sheeting, covering an area averaging 2,200 feet by 400 feet by a lengthened
  ridge, or in separate tents on isolated supports. Others display the solution of this problem by
  the chapter-house principle, and a few by the umbrella or circular locomotive-engine-house system
  of railway-stations, either with a central column or groups of columns sustaining domes or roofs
  to the extent of four hundred feet diameter.</p>

  <p>"Grandeur and simplicity of distribution are carried out with great architectural effect in
  other compositions, and the general arrangement by columnar supports has been also variously and
  elegantly developed. The system of iron roofing, with all the architectural powers of which that
  material is susceptible, has been adopted by some with signal enterprise, ingenuity, and
  power.</p>

  <p>"In another class of design the authors have viewed with enthusiasm the great occasion and
  object of the proposed Exhibition, and have waived all considerations of expense. They have
  indulged their imaginations, and employed the resources of their genius and learning, in the
  composition of arrangements which present the utmost grandeur and beauty of architecture, suited
  to a permanent Palace of Science and Art. These, as addressed to the architectural Student, are of
  the highest value, reminding him of all the conditions of his art&mdash;the Egyptian hypostyle,
  the Roman thermæ, or of the Arabian or Saracenic inventions. And though their expense has placed
  them beyond reach, they cannot fail to inspire and elevate the treatment of the reality. They at
  all events confer great obligations on the lovers of the Fine Arts, for the authors have evidently
  felt that, if one of the results to be expected from the proposed Exhibition may be to prove that
  the simplest object of ingenuity and skill should not be <span class="pagenum"
  id="page13">{13}</span>devoid of some of the attractions of taste, the Building itself ought to be
  an illustration of that important principle.</p>

  <p>"The Committee, however, have been unable to select any one design as combining all the
  requisites which various considerations render essential. But the judgment and taste evinced by a
  large number of the contributors have enabled the Committee to arrive more promptly at their
  conclusions, and they have freely availed themselves of most valuable suggestions in directing the
  preparation of a fresh design for the proposed building.</p>

  <p>"They have consequently been most earnest in the desire to fulfil the just expectations of the
  various competitors, and feel assured that your Royal Highness and the Commission will be of
  opinion that the most unreserved and handsome acknowledgments are due to those able men of science
  and art who have in so disinterested a manner submitted such admirable projects for the
  consideration and assistance of the Committee. They beg, therefore, to submit, as their opinion,
  that the following gentlemen are entitled to honourable and favourable mention, on account of
  architectural merit, ingenious construction or disposition, or for graceful arrangement of
  plan.</p>

  <p>"And they cannot conclude without calling attention to the designs, accompanied by models, of
  M. Hector Horeau, Architect of Paris, and of Messrs. Turner, of Dublin, as evincing most daring
  and ingenious disposition and construction.<a id="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ar">"<span class="sc">W. Cubitt</span>, <i>Chairman</i>."</p>

  <p>Some of the strongest objections to this Report are very fairly urged in a letter which
  appeared in the <i>Builder</i> of the 15th of June, a part of which is subjoined<span
  class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"Part II. of the Report contains what I suppose is to be taken as the best exposition of the
  merits of contributors that the Committee can give, which commences by stating, in a tone of
  commendation, that, 'not confining themselves to <span class="smaller">SUGGESTIONS ONLY</span>,
  which were invited by the <span class="smaller">PROGRAMME</span>, a large proportion of them are
  remarkable for elaboration of thought and elegance of execution.' This, I would contend, is
  clearly a breach of the specified conditions, viz., that <span class="smaller">SUGGESTIONS
  ONLY</span> were to be given&mdash;that the plan or drawing sent in was to be <span
  class="smaller">A MERE OUTLINE SKETCH</span>, upon a <span class="smaller">SINGLE SHEET</span>;
  and the Committee even recommended that it would be most convenient merely to trace it upon the
  common paper on which the 'plan of site' was supplied to the public, a space being left upon the
  sheet for <span class="smaller">SKETCHING</span> any sections or elevations that might be
  necessary to illustrate the design; and that a written description, limited also to 'a single
  sheet,' was all the exposition of their ideas that authors would be <span class="pagenum"
  id="page14">{14}</span>allowed to give. The Report goes on to state, that 'our illustrious
  continental neighbours have especially distinguished themselves [in designing a temporary building
  for an exhibition] by compositions of the utmost taste and learning, worthy of enduring
  execution&mdash;examples of what might be done in the <span class="smaller">ARCHITECTURAL</span>
  illustration of the subject [the conditions strictly enjoined contributors not to enter into
  architectural detail] when viewed in its highest aspect, and, at all events, exhibiting features
  of grandeur, arrangement, and grace which your Committee have not failed to appreciate.' It then
  places in contradistinction to these no doubt admirable but out-of-place productions of
  architectural genius, the 'practical character of the designs of our own countrymen,' which it
  states, 'as might have been expected, has been remarkably illustrated in some very striking and
  simple methods, suited to the temporary purposes of the building, due attention having been paid
  by them to the pecuniary means allotted to this part of the undertaking.' Yet, notwithstanding
  this comparison, clearly and indisputably in favour of our own countrymen, as regards the object
  sought and the conditions stipulated by the Committee, we find by the selected list of those
  authors who are to receive 'the highest honorary distinction' the Commissioners can award, that
  the Committee can only discover, out of 195 English and 38 foreign contributors, <span
  class="smaller">THREE</span> Englishmen entitled to reward, the remaining <span
  class="smaller">FIFTEEN</span> out of the eighteen selected being foreigners; or, as regards the
  whole numbers, in proportion of 1 to 65 of 'our own countrymen,' the authors of the 'striking and
  simple,' so admirably 'suited to the temporary purpose of the building,' and 1 to about 2½ of
  foreigners, who, in designing for a temporary building, to be simple, cheap, and readily
  constructed, have so overshot the mark as to produce 'compositions' commendable only for the
  'utmost taste and learning, and worthy of enduring execution.' Surely something must be wrong
  here, either the Report or the selected list&mdash;possibly both.</p>

  <p>"In conclusion, I cannot help avowing the opinion that a wrong, though I believe
  unintentionally, has been done to many of the 233 who so readily and 'generously' responded to the
  call for their ideas; more particularly as I know, from personal inspection, that at least <span
  class="smaller">ONE</span> of the plans altogether omitted from the Report contains <span
  class="smaller">FIVE</span> of the leading features of the approved design."</p>

  <p>But to judge of this matter fairly, it must be mentioned that, although the number of foreign
  competitors was small, the majority of them were men already well known for their talents and
  professional skill; in all cases their designs evinced considerable study of the subject (both
  architecturally and in a practical point of view), and manifested a desire to exhibit to English
  professional men the proficiency of their continental brethren. On the other hand, many of the
  designs from the competitors at home were much slighter suggestions presented in a less elaborate
  form. Under these <span class="pagenum" id="page15">{15}</span>circumstances, it is not to be
  wondered at that those eminent men of the technical professions who, on this occasion, came
  forward with practical suggestions for the assistance of the Committee, and designs calculated
  rather to assist with thoughts than to charm by the graces of elegant drawing or symmetrical
  disposition, should seem to have been found wanting in this first trial with all the world. It
  should further be borne in mind, that the nature of competitions is not so well understood in some
  foreign countries, where they are of less frequent occurrence, than with us. It must at the same
  time be admitted that the practice of disregarding and exceeding the instructions in competitions
  is too much a matter of general complaint in England to be brought forward as a new grievance
  against our continental brethren.</p>

  <p class="sp5">After the publication of the above Report, the competition designs were all
  exhibited in the rooms of the Institution of Civil Engineers, in Great George-street, which were
  liberally placed at the disposal of the Committee for this purpose; and of those who visited this
  interesting exhibition, many, no doubt, must have sympathised with those feelings which dictated
  the decision of the Committee. From an attentive examination of these designs, presenting the
  subject in such exceedingly varied forms, one of the peculiar difficulties of the case becomes
  apparent, namely, the total absence of any precedent to guide or afford suggestions to the
  designer; for the small number of buildings erected or adapted for a similar purpose have been on
  so limited a scale that their example could not afford much assistance in designing a structure to
  meet all the requirements of the present case. This building differed from all previous ones in
  being intended to accommodate the products of all nations, instead of being confined to those of
  one only; in which case the arrangement would have been more certain and more readily provided
  for.</p>

  a comparison of some of these earlier buildings with the first erected in London for a similar
  purpose cannot fail to be interesting, a short notice of them may not be deemed out of place. The
  most important amongst them are those temporary structures which have been erected in Paris for
  the periodical Industrial Expositions, with reference to the last of which we cannot do better
  than quote, from Mr. Digby Wyatt's instructive and masterly Report, that part where the building
  is treated of<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The vast edifice which has been erected to contain the specimens of manufacture selected for
  exhibition in the year 1849 is situated on the same site as that occupied by a similar building in
  the year 1844. The Carré <span class="pagenum" id="page16">{16}</span>de Marigny, on which it has
  been placed, is a large oblong piece of ground, abutting on the main avenue of the Champs Elysées,
  and as a site offers every possible advantage, being of a gravelly soil, already efficiently
  drained, and standing on the line of a continually moving series of public conveyances. The Champs
  Elysées, though at some considerable distance from the great centre of Parisian population, are
  still so universal a place of resort, that they may be fairly assumed to be "in the way" of even
  the poorest classes of the community. The elevation may be admirably seen from all the approaches
  to the building, and it has the advantage of being in immediate proximity to the residence of the
  President of the Republic.</p>

  <p>"The whole plot of the present building (exclusive of the agricultural department) covers a
  vast parallelogram of 206 metres by 100 (about 675 by 328 feet English), round the outline of
  which runs a gallery about 90 feet wide, divided into two avenues by a double range of pilasters.
  In the centre of each avenue is a set of stalls, placed back to back, for the exhibition of
  merchandise; and both between the central pilasters, and round, and upon the walls, other objects
  are placed, so that on traversing either of the four gangways (each about ten feet wide) the
  public have upon their right and left hands objects for inspection. In the part of the building
  appropriated to large machinery, of course this system cannot be carried out with the same
  regularity. The vast parallelogram, inclosed by a somewhat similar gallery in the year 1844, was
  left as one magnificent hall, within which were placed the most important objects; in the present
  building we find it divided by two transverse galleries, similarly arranged to those we have
  described, forming three court-yards; the central one being about 140 feet square, and the two
  lateral ones 80 feet by 140. The central court-yard is open to the sky; in the middle rises an
  elegant fountain placed on a platform of turf, and around are disposed sheds for the exhibition of
  flowers and horticultural ornaments and implements. One of the lateral courts (inclosed) receives
  a large collection of objects in metal-work, cast-iron, &amp;c., and the other contains an immense
  reservoir, in which all the drainage from the roofs is collected, so as to form a supply of water
  immediately serviceable in case of fire. In addition to this great building, which corresponds
  with that previously erected, there is this year constructed a vast shed for the exhibition of
  agricultural produce and stock. It extends to a length rather greater than the width of the great
  parallelogram, and is about 100 feet (English) wide. Its construction is <span class="pagenum"
  id="page18">{18}</span>ruder than that of the 'Palace,' but it is not on that account less
  effective. It appears to have been originally contemplated to fill the whole of this gigantic hall
  with cattle, &amp;c., and to place the agricultural implements in a long narrow gallery
  intervening between it and the main building; but as the stock of animals forwarded for exhibition
  has not proved so large as was anticipated, it has been half-filled with semi-agricultural
  machines, and the whole of the long narrow gallery alluded to crammed with stoves, and
  miscellaneous domestic mechanism.</p>

  <p>"The whole of the building is constructed of wood, the roofs being covered with zinc: of the
  latter material 400,000 kilogrammes, equal to nearly 4,000 tons, are stated to have been used; and
  of the former, nearly 45,000  pieces of timber.</p>

  <p>"It is hoped that the accompanying plan and views will convey a tolerably good idea both of the
  exterior and interior arrangements of the Exhibition. They will serve to show, at least, that a
  somewhat unnecessary expenditure has been gone into, and to manifest the possibility of
  constructing a much more simple building, possessing all the advantages of this one, at a far less
  cost.</p>

  <p>"Both externally and internally there is a good deal of tasteless and unprofitable ornament;
  all the pilasters are papered and painted in a species of graining to imitate light oak, and even
  the ceiling is covered over with the same work. Large 'carton pierre' trusses apparently support
  the timbers, and a painted bronze bas-relief fills the tympanum of the pediment, at the principal
  entrance. The architecture of the whole is 'mesquin,' although the gigantic scale of the building
  necessarily elevates the general effect into something of impressiveness; not, however, to nearly
  the extent which the same outlay might have produced."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wyatt further states that the total cost of this building was about 450,000  francs, or
  about 18,000<i>l.</i>, which, however, he considers was an unnecessarily large outlay. He
  mentions, also, that the building erected on the previous occasion, in 1844, was in some respects
  more suitable for the purpose, especially from its greater simplicity of arrangement, a remark it
  will be well to bear in mind in considering the various designs for the building in Hyde Park. The
  accompanying plates will enable the reader readily to follow all the details of the
  description.</p>

  <p>The permanent building erected by the King of Bavaria at Munich, likewise for periodical
  Exhibitions, is on a much smaller scale than those in Paris, and must be regarded rather as having
  afforded an opportunity for that manifestation of architectural display in public buildings for
  which its Royal projector was so well known, than as being peculiarly fitted for its purpose. It
  is divided internally into various halls for the different classes of objects; but as the
  proportion of these must necessarily vary at every Exhibition, such an arrangement cannot be
  deemed the most suitable for the purpose.</p>

  <p class="sp3">At Berlin, where several Industrial Exhibitions have taken place, no distinct
  building has been provided, but some already existing one has been temporarily adapted and fitted
  up for the purpose; thus, on the last occasion, Kroll's <span class="sc">Wintergarten</span>, a
  large establishment for public amusement, which has been recently destroyed by fire, was made use
  of. The large central saloon, with the smaller ones flanking it, forming, in fact, one space 310
  feet long, and 82 feet broad at the widest point, afforded a very good opportunity for the
  arrangement of the objects to be exhibited, some of which were placed in the gallery of the large
  saloon.</p>

  <p>On a previous occasion a part of the Royal Arsenal building was appropriated, and the
  Exhibition embraced two storeys.</p>

  <p>In our own country, exhibitions of manufactures have taken place in several of the most
  important towns, generally in spaces only temporarily adapted; but in 1849 the first building in
  this country intended solely for the purpose of an exhibition of manufactures was erected at
  Birmingham, on the occasion of the meeting of the British Association in that town.</p>

  <p>The building alluded to included a space extending to 10,000 square feet, and a corridor,
  giving additional accommodation of 800 square feet, connected the temporary exhibition-room with
  Bingley-house, within the grounds of which the building was erected; and including the rooms of
  the old mansion, the total area covered by the Exhibition was equal to 12,800 feet, or only about
  one-seventeenth of the area covered by the last building erected in the Champs Elysées. The cost
  of this building was about 1,300<i>l.</i> It was opened to the public on the 3rd of September,
  1849.</p>

  <p>In most of the buildings alluded to above, the principal defect seemed to be that a definite
  and fixed subdivision of space was made for a classification of objects which was necessarily
  uncertain. This appears to have determined the Committee in the arrangement of the plan which they
  presented in a general form to the Royal Commission at the same time with the Report already
  quoted; and although the design was slightly modified during the progress of the working-drawings
  subsequently made, this is, perhaps, the best place for introducing a description of it.</p>

  <p class="sp5">It has been already mentioned that at the time the Committee received the
  competition designs, they obtained the assistance of Mr. Digby Wyatt, the secretary to the
  Executive Committee, to aid them in the preparation of drawings, although Mr. Scott Russell
  officially filled the post of secretary to the Building Committee. At a somewhat later stage of
  the Committee's proceedings, when the general design for the proposed building had been approved
  by the Royal Commission, and it became necessary to prepare working drawings for the same with
  extraordinary despatch, Mr. Charles Heard Wild, as engineer, and Mr. Owen Jones, as architect,
  were appointed to co-operate with Mr. Wyatt in carrying out this object.</p>

  site to have been occupied by the building designed by the Committee was the same as that on which
  the building has been actually erected, namely between Rotten-row and the drive in Hyde Park, but
  the area proposed to be covered was somewhat larger, the length of the building being about 2,200
  feet, and the greatest width nearly 450 feet. The central space was occupied by an immense rotunda
  200 feet in diameter, the cupola rising to a height of more than 160 feet, and exceeding the span
  of that of St. Peter's at Rome by 61 feet, and of St. Paul's in London by 88 feet. The dome for
  covering this rotunda consisted of wrought-iron ribs, supporting a covering of corrugated iron,
  the whole resting on a wall or drum of brickwork, about 60 feet high; a large opening in the
  centre was to be glazed for the admission of light.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page22">{22}</span></div>

  <p>This large open area was intended for the exhibition of groups of sculpture, fountains, and
  other objects requiring great space in order to be seen to advantage; at the same time the cupola
  would have presented a striking instance of the constructive skill of this country.</p>

  <p>The remaining area of the building was divided into avenues 48 feet wide, by iron columns 24
  feet apart, this dimension having been determined on as that most likely to work in well for the
  division of the counters and passages. One of the 48-feet avenues on the main axis of the building
  was spanned by semicircular ribs of wrought iron supporting the roof, which rose here to a greater
  height than the rest of the building; the other avenues were covered with roofing very similar to
  that commonly seen in railway-sheds, the whole being rendered as light as possible, and
  constructed in iron covered with slating; the light being in all cases admitted by a range of
  sky-lights at the apex of the roof, which was also adapted for ventilation. The height of the main
  avenue was 52 feet, and of the others 36 feet, from the floor throughout. A corridor of
  communication 15 feet wide was carried round the whole of the building, interrupted only by the
  open courts; this, with the main avenue, afforded the visitor to the Exhibition the means of
  reaching any particular point without threading a maze of small passages. The inclosing walls were
  to be of brick, relieved externally by panels in two colours; but there were to be no internal
  division walls except those necessary to surround the various courts which were left on account of
  the trees.</p>

  <p>The executive offices were grouped on either side of the principal entrance, which was placed
  immediately opposite Prince's Gate; and at this, as well as at the entrances at either end and on
  the north front, large arched recesses were introduced which served as vestibules, and formed at
  the same time prominent and striking features to relieve the necessarily monotonous aspect of the
  building. Along the whole of the principal front and at the ends of the building a pent or
  overhanging roof projected about 15 feet, to enable visitors in bad weather to be set down under
  cover, and the exit-doors, of which there were altogether 24, were further protected by
  porches.</p>

  <p>The water was to be conveyed from the roof through the columns which supported it, and which
  were for this purpose connected with the necessary drain-pipes, &amp;c.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Very ample accommodation was provided for refreshments in the open courts which
  were necessarily left for the preservation of the trees, particularly in that at the western end
  of the building, where there was proposed to be placed a large establishment, comprising two
  storeys, with somewhat the arrangement of the French cafés, including a fine saloon on the first
  floor, upwards of thirty feet wide and nearly one hundred feet long; separate spaces were also
  provided for the accommodation of exhibitors. This was the only part of the building, with the
  exception of the executive offices, which was to have an upper storey.</p>

  <p>An objection might, perhaps, be raised to this part of the building, that it was too
  commodious, and that there might be some danger of its being converted into a lounge, while it was
  occupying too much of the space intended for the Exhibition, for a secondary, though certainly
  necessary purpose; it was, however, considered by the Committee, that of the vast number of
  visitors that might be expected to be in the building at one time, so many would avail themselves
  of the accommodation provided as to render a less amount undesirable. The principal courts were
  surrounded by a covered way, where refreshments were also to be served at long counters, in the
  manner of the railway-stations.</p>

  <p>All these arrangements will readily be understood by a reference to the plan of the design we
  have been describing, which plan, together with a view taken from the south-east angle of the
  building, will place before the reader the result of the labours of the Committee. The materials
  proposed for the construction of this building were fire-proof throughout, with the exception of
  the floor and its supporting timbers.</p>

  <p>The above design, at least in all its leading features, for some of the details were
  subsequently added, was laid before the Royal Commission, at the same time with the Report already
  quoted, and was by them approved, and the Committee proceeded to prepare the necessary
  working-drawings and specifications for the execution of the work. These proceedings of the
  Committee occupied until the 24th of June, when large lithographed copies of the most important of
  the drawings, together with printed copies of the specifications and other details, were issued
  from the offices of the Executive, contractors having been some time previously invited by public
  advertisement to send in tenders for the execution of either a part or the whole of the work. The
  tenders were to be on two systems, one on the supposition that the Royal Commission were to become
  the <i>bona fide</i> purchasers of the building; the other, that the contractors were to erect and
  maintain the building during the time of the Exhibition, after which they were to remove it and
  take back the materials at their own risk, receiving a proportionably diminished sum.</p>

  <p class="sp5">It has been considered necessary to describe thus minutely the labours of the
  Committee and the design in which they resulted, in order to show how far it paved the way for
  that which was subsequently adopted, and to give them that credit which they undoubtedly deserve
  for devoting so much of their valuable time for the furtherance of a great public undertaking.</p>

  alt="T"/>HE design of the Building Committee, when published to the world, met with anything but
  public approbation; some of the objectors called in question the practicability of the execution
  of the enormous dome, at least within the time assigned; others complained that the outlay would
  be unnecessarily large for a purpose avowedly temporary, and expressed their fears that so costly
  a structure once erected, there would be the less probability of its subsequent removal; but the
  objection which appeared to have most weight with the public at large was, the great amount of
  solid brick construction in the walls, &amp;c., which, it was urged, would require a longer time
  than could be allowed for their erection, and that the carting of the materials would cause
  serious injury in the Park and the surrounding neighbourhood. This strong current of objection
  seemed to bid fair to overwhelm the much-abused design. To increase the difficulties which seemed
  to gather round the progress of this noble undertaking, an exceedingly vexatious and factious
  agitation was got up in opposition to the proposed site in Hyde Park, and petitions and
  counter-petitions were presented to both Houses of Parliament, and much of the time of the
  Legislature was wasted in fruitless discussion on the subject. The Building Committee thought it
  desirable, under these circumstances, to lay before the public their reasons for recommending the
  site in the Park, and therefore issued a memorandum of the grounds on which it had been
  selected.<a id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The result was, that the opposition was
  defeated in the Legislature, and finally crushed by the force of public opinion.</p>

  their tenders ready by the 10th of July, when, altogether, nineteen were sent in, but eight only
  were for undertaking the whole of the work; the amounts of these are stated to have ranged between
  150,000<i>l.</i> and 120,000<i>l.</i>, and this for the use only of the materials for the
  building. But, at the same time, in accordance with the recommendation and invitation contained in
  the last part of the Report already quoted, Messrs. Fox, Henderson and Co. presented a tender upon
  a design entirely different in construction and appearance, though resembling that of the
  Committee in the general arrangement of the plan.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page25">{25}</span></div>

  <p>This design was by Mr. Joseph Paxton, and resembled in its general form the building as it is
  now executed, with the exception of the transept and semicircular roof, which were subsequently
  added, and were suggested by Mr. Barry.</p>

  <p>The result of the tenders appears to have been unfavourable to the Committee's design; and in
  their Report to the Royal Commission on the subject, made a few days afterwards, they proposed to
  omit the great dome and some portions of the design which were not essential, by which they
  considered that the cost of its execution might be reduced below 100,000<i>l.</i>; at the same
  time, they made special mention of Mr. Paxton's design, which, however, they considered would
  prove more expensive.</p>

  <p>Mr. Paxton's design had been brought before the public before this period; for, considering
  that his best road to success would be to get a favourable verdict from that many-headed jury, he
  published a view and description of it in the <i>Illustrated News</i>, and, through the influence
  of Mr. Stephenson, he got his plans laid before the Royal Commission, in consequence of which he
  obtained an interview with his Royal Highness the President. The encouragement given him by the
  attention bestowed upon his design by the Royal Commission, and the favourable opinion of the
  public, had determined him to procure a tender for the execution of the work, to be sent in with
  those upon the Committee's design. This he was enabled to do by the great energy and promptitude
  of the contractors, Messrs. Fox and Henderson, to whom he applied at the eleventh hour. The
  difficulties that had to be overcome, owing to the shortness of the time remaining for the
  estimates to be made up, can scarcely be better laid before the reader than they have been by an
  able writer in "Household Words:"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"It was now Saturday, and only a few days more were allowed for receiving tenders. Yet before
  an approximate estimate of expense could be formed, the great glass-manufacturers and iron-masters
  of the north had to be consulted. This happened to be <i>dies mirabilis</i> the third; for it was
  the identical Saturday on which the Sunday postal question had reached its crisis, and there was
  to be no delivery the next day! But in a country of electric telegraphs, and of indomitable
  energy, time and difficulties are annihilated; and it is not the least of the marvels wrought in
  connexion with the great edifice that, by aid of railway-parcels and the electric telegraph, not
  only did all the gentlemen summoned out of Warwickshire and Staffordshire appear on Monday morning
  at Messrs. Fox and Henderson's office, in Spring Gardens, London, to contribute their several
  estimates to the tender for the whole, but within a week the contractors had prepared every
  detailed working-drawing, and had calculated the cost of every pound of iron, of every inch of
  wood, and of every pane of glass.</p>

  <p>"There is no one circumstance in the history of the manufacturing enterprise of the English
  nation which places in so strong a light as this <span class="pagenum" id="page26">{26}</span>its
  boundless resources in materials, to say nothing of the arithmetical skill in computing at what
  cost and in how short a time those materials could be converted to a special purpose. What was
  done in those few days? Two parties in London, relying on the accuracy and good faith of certain
  iron-masters, glass-workers in the provinces, and of one master-carpenter in London, bound
  themselves for a certain sum of money, and in the course of some four months, to cover eighteen
  acres of ground with a building upwards of a third of a mile long, and some four hundred and fifty
  feet broad. In order to do this, the glass-maker promised to supply, in the required time, nine
  hundred thousand square feet of glass (weighing more than four hundred tons), in separate panes,
  and these the largest that ever were made of sheet glass; each being forty-nine inches long. The
  iron-master passed his word in like manner to cast in due time three thousand three hundred iron
  columns, varying from fourteen feet and a half to twenty feet in length: thirty-four miles of
  guttering-tube, to join every individual column together under the ground; two thousand two
  hundred and twenty-four girders (but some of these are of wrought iron); besides eleven hundred
  and twenty-eight bearers for supporting galleries. The carpenter undertook to get ready within the
  specified period two hundred and five <span class="smaller">MILES</span> of sash-bar, flooring for
  an area of thirty-three millions of cubic feet, besides enormous quantities of wooden walling,
  louvre-work, and partition.<a id="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

  <p>"It is not till we reflect on the vast sums of money involved in transactions of this magnitude
  that we can form even a slight notion of the great, almost ruinous loss, a trifling arithmetical
  error would have occasioned, and of the boundless confidence the parties must have had in their
  resources and in the correctness of their computations. Nevertheless, it was one great merit in
  Mr. Paxton's original details of measurement that they were contrived to facilitate
  calculation.</p>

  <p>"There was little time for consideration, or for setting right a single mistake, were it ever
  so disastrous. On the prescribed day the tender was presented, with whatever imperfections it
  might have had, duly and irredeemably sealed. But after-checkings have divulged no material
  error."</p>

  <p class="sp5">The Royal Commission appear from the first to have been favourably impressed with
  Mr. Paxton's design, partly, no doubt, because its adoption would at once silence the great
  bricks-and-mortar objection to the occupation of the site in Hyde Park; and the result was that,
  on the 16th of July, Messrs. Fox and Henderson's tender of 79,800<i>l.</i> for Mr. Paxton's design
  was verbally accepted, and, as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made, the contract was
  formally concluded.</p>

  Mr. Paxton himself has stated, the design for a building of such magnitude could not have been
  produced in so short a space of time without the aid of the experience he had gained in
  constructing other great buildings of a somewhat similar character; the progress of this
  experience Mr. Paxton has described in the lecture he delivered to the Society of Arts on the 13th
  of November, 1850, from which we have made the following extracts; and we hope to be excused by
  the reader for their copiousness, on the ground that no man can so well relate his own doings as
  the actor himself<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The Great Industrial Building now in the course of erection, and which forms the subject of
  the present paper, was not the production of a momentary consideration of the subject. Its
  peculiar construction, in cast-iron and glass, together with the manner of forming the vast roof,
  is the result of much experience in the erection of buildings of a similar kind, although on a
  smaller scale, which has gradually developed itself through a series of years. It may not,
  therefore, be uninteresting to give a brief account of the reasons which led me to investigate the
  subject of glass roofs and glass structures generally, and which have resulted in the Exhibition
  Building.</p>

  <p>"In 1828, when I first turned my attention to the building and improvement of glass structures,
  the various forcing-houses at Chatsworth, as at other places, were formed of coarse thick glass
  and heavy woodwork, which rendered the roofs dark and gloomy, and, on this account, very ill
  suited for the purposes they were intended to answer. My first object was to remove this evil,
  and, in order to accomplish it, I lightened the rafters and sash-bars, by bevelling off their
  sides; and some houses which were afterwards built in this manner proved very satisfactory. I also
  at this time contrived a light sash-bar, having a groove for the reception of the glass; this
  groove completely obviated a disadvantage connected with the old mode of glazing, namely, the
  putty becoming continually displaced by sun, frost, and rain, after the sashes had been made for a
  short time, and the wet by this means finding its way betwixt the glass and the wood, and
  producing a continual drip in rainy weather.</p>

  <p>"About this period the desire for metallic roofs began to extend in every direction; and as
  such structures had a light and graceful appearance, it became a question of importance as to the
  propriety of using metal sashes and rafters, instead of wooden ones, for horticultural purposes.
  After carefully observing the effects of those built by various persons, it became apparent to me
  that the expansion and contraction of metal would always militate against its general adoption, as
  at no season of the year could the sashes and rafters be made to fit.</p>

  <p>"The extra expense, also, of erecting metallic-roofed houses was a <span class="pagenum"
  id="page28">{28}</span>consideration. In 1833 I contemplated building a new range of hot-houses;
  and being desirous of knowing how much they would cost, if erected of metal, a plan of the range
  was prepared and sent to Birmingham, and another to Sheffield, with a desire to be furnished with
  estimates for that purpose. The estimate from Birmingham was 1,800<i>l.</i>; and the other, from
  Sheffield, was 1,850<i>l.</i> These appeared to me such enormous sums, that I at once set about
  calculating how much the range would cost if built of wood under my own inspection; and the result
  was, that I was able to complete the whole range, including masonry (which was omitted in the
  metal estimates), for less than 500<i>l.</i></p>

  <p>"Besides the extra cost of metallic roofs, we must add the extreme heat of such houses in hot
  weather, and their coldness in times of frost; the liability to breakage of glass from expansion
  and contraction of the metal; the very limited duration of the smaller portions, as sash-bars,
  from corrosion, by exposure to the alternations of heat, cold, and moisture, inseparable from
  gardening operations, and which could only be prevented by making use of the expensive material,
  <span class="smaller">COPPER</span>; and the difficulty, when compared with wood, of repairing any
  damages, as a wooden roof could at any time be set to rights by a common carpenter. These
  different items formed in my mind so many objections to its use, and the same disadvantages soon
  became generally apparent.</p>

  <p>"It was now thought advisable by some parties that, in order to obviate the many disadvantages
  in the use of metal, the rafters and frame-work of the sashes ought to be made of wood, and the
  sash-bars of metal. This plan certainly presented more advantages than the other, yet it was quite
  obvious that materials so incongruous could never give satisfaction; and accordingly, in a few
  years, as I had anticipated, the rage for these structures gradually subsided, and the use of wood
  again became resorted to by most persons, as the best material for horticultural purposes.</p>

  <p>"In the construction of glass-houses requiring much light, there always appeared to me one
  important objection, which no person seemed to have taken up or obviated; it was this. In plain
  lean-to or shed roofs, the morning and evening sun, which is on many accounts of the greatest
  importance in forcing fruits, presented its direct rays at a low angle, and, consequently, very
  obliquely to the glass. At those periods most of <span class="pagenum" id="page29">{29}</span>the
  rays of light and heat were obstructed by the position of the glass and heavy rafters, so that a
  considerable portion of time was lost both morning and evening; it consequently became evident
  that a system by which the glass would be more at right angles to the morning and evening rays of
  the sun would obviate the difficulty, and remove the obstruction to rays of light entering the
  house at an early and late hour of the day.</p>

  <div class="ac w35 fcenter sp2">
    <a href="images/p29.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/p29.jpg"
    alt="METHOD BY RIDGE-AND-FURROW." title="METHOD BY RIDGE-AND-FURROW."/></a>
    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0">METHOD BY RIDGE-AND-FURROW.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"This led me to the adoption of the ridge-and-furrow principle for glass roofs, which places
  the glass in such a position that the rays of light in the mornings and evenings enter the house
  without obstruction, and present themselves more perpendicularly to the glass at those times when
  they are the least powerful; whereas at mid-day, when they are most powerful, they present
  themselves more obliquely to the glass. Having had this principle fixed in my mind, and being
  convinced of its importance, I constructed a pine-house in 1833 as an experiment, which still
  exists unimpaired, and has been found fully to answer the purpose.</p>

  <p>"In 1834 I resolved to try a further experiment on a larger scale, on the ridge-and-furrow
  principle, in the construction of a green-house of considerable dimensions, which also remains and
  answers admirably. For this building I made a still lighter sash-bar than any I had previously
  used; on which account the house, when completed (although possessing all the advantages of wood),
  was as light as if constructed of metal. The whole length of this structure is 97½ feet, and its
  breadth 26 feet; the height at the back is 16 feet 9 inches, and in the front 12 feet 3 inches. A
  span so large as 26 feet could not be safely covered with a roof constructed in the ordinary way,
  unless the sash-bars were stronger, and the assistance of heavy rafters and numerous supports was
  afforded. The house presents a neat and light appearance, and consists of 15 bays, and pediments
  in front, supported by 16 slender reeded cast-iron columns. Whilst it makes an admirable
  green-house, it is also an economical building; for, at the period of its construction,
  notwithstanding the heavy tax on glass (since removed), it only cost at the rate of twopence and a
  fraction per cubic foot. At the present time, considering the change in the price of material, and
  the removal of the glass-tax, it could be constructed at a considerably smaller amount.</p>

  <p>"Having in contemplation the erection of the Great Conservatory in its present form, it was
  determined, in 1836, to erect a new curvilinear <span class="pagenum"
  id="page30">{30}</span>hot-house 60 feet in length and 26 feet in width, with the elliptical roof
  on the ridge-and-furrow principle, to be constructed entirely of wood, for the purpose of
  exhibiting how roofs of this kind could be supported. The plan adopted was this: the curved
  rafters were composed of several boards securely nailed together on templets of wood cut to the
  exact curve; by this means a strength and firmness were obtained sufficient to support an enormous
  weight.</p>

  <p>"In 1837 the foundations of the Great Conservatory were commenced; and in constructing so great
  a building it was found desirable to contrive some means for abridging the great amount of manual
  labour that would be required in making the immense number of sash-bars requisite for the purpose.
  Accordingly, I visited all the great workshops in London, Manchester, and Birmingham, to see if
  anything had been invented that would afford the facilities I required. The only apparatus met
  with was a grooving-machine, which I had at once connected with a steam-engine at Chatsworth, and
  which was subsequently so improved as to make the sash-bar complete.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"For this apparatus the Society of Arts, in April, 1841, awarded me a medal; and this machine
  is the type from which all the sash-bar machines found in use throughout the country at the
  present time are taken. As the Conservatory was erected under my own immediate superintendence, I
  am able to speak accurately as to the advantages of the machine: it has, in regard to that
  building alone, saved in expenses 1,400<i>l.</i> The length of each of the bars of the
  Conservatory is 48 inches; only one inch shorter than those of the Exhibition Building. The
  machine was first used in its present form in August, 1838; and its original cost, including
  table, wheels, and everything complete, was 20<i>l.</i> The motive power is from a steam-engine
  employed on the premises for other purposes; and any well-seasoned timber may be used. The
  attendants required are only a man and a boy, and the expense of the power required for it when in
  use is comparatively trifling. The sash-bars may be made of any form, by changing the character of
  the saws.</p>

  <p>"There is one particular feature in working the machine, namely, the bar is presented to the
  saws below the centre of motion, instead of above it (as is usual); and to the sides of the saw
  which are ascending from the table, instead of those which are descending. These arrangements were
  necessary to suit the direction of the teeth to the grain of the wood; for when the bars were
  presented to the saws in the usual way, the wood was <span class="pagenum"
  id="page31">{31}</span>crushed instead of being cut and cleaned. It is essential that the machine
  should revolve 1,200 times in a minute to finish the work in a proper manner.</p>

  <p>"The glass and glazing of the Chatsworth Conservatory caused me considerable thought and
  anxiety, as I was very desirous to do away altogether with the numerous overlaps connected with
  the old system of glazing with short lengths. This old method, even under the best of management,
  is certain, in the course of a few years, to render unsightly any structure, however well
  built.</p>

  <p>"In the course of my inquiries, I heard that Messrs. Chance and Co., of Birmingham, had just
  introduced from the Continent the manufacture of sheet glass. Accordingly, I went to see them make
  this new article, and found they were able to manufacture it three feet in length. I was advised
  to use this glass in two lengths, with one overlap; but to this I could not assent, as I observed,
  that since they had so far advanced as to be able to produce sheets three feet in length, I saw no
  reason why they could not accomplish another foot; and, if this could not be done, I would decline
  giving the order, as, at that time, sheet glass was altogether an experiment for horticultural
  purposes. These gentlemen, however, shortly afterwards informed me that they had one person who
  could make it the desired length, and, if I would give the order, they would furnish me with all I
  required.</p>

  <p>"It may just be remarked here that the glass for the Exhibition Building is forty-nine inches
  long&mdash;a size which no country except England is able to furnish in any large quantity, even
  at the present day.</p>

  <p>"In 1840 the Chatsworth Conservatory was completed and planted. The whole length of this
  building is 277 feet; its breadth, 123 feet over the walls; and the height, from the floor to the
  highest part, 67 feet.</p>

  <p>"Notwithstanding the success which attended the erection of these buildings, it became to me a
  question of importance how far an extensive structure might be covered in with <i>flat</i>
  ridge-and-furrow roofs; that is, the ridge-and-valley rafters placed on a level, instead of at an
  inclination, as in the green-house, or curvilinear, as in the Great Conservatory. I therefore
  prepared some plans for an erection of the kind for the Earl of Burlington, somewhere about ten
  years ago; but, on account of the lamented death of the Countess, the design of erection was
  abandoned. However, from that time I felt assured, not only that it could be done satisfactorily,
  but that the most appropriate manner to form and support level glass roofs, to a great extent, was
  that adopted this year for the New Victoria House at Chatsworth, which may be considered a
  miniature type of the Great Industrial Building.</p>

  <p>"Before describing this house, however, it may be well to notice two <span class="pagenum"
  id="page32">{32}</span>instances in which the flat roofs had been previously tried, and in both
  cases with the most perfect success.</p>

  <p>"The first of these was a conservatory attached to a villa in Darley Dale, only a short
  distance from Chatsworth. This building is divided into five bays, with a glass door in the
  centre, and glass pilasters separating the bays; the ridge-and-furrow roof covers an opening of
  seventeen feet in the clear. The ventilation is simultaneously effected by a lever connected with
  a rod, which is attached to all the ventilators....</p>

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0">THE VICTORIA REGIA HOUSE, CHATSWORTH.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"The second instance is this. In the spring of 1848, plans were prepared for the erection of an
  ornamental glass structure, to cover the conservatory wall at Chatsworth. This wall was previously
  a plain flued structure, devoted to the growth of rare and choice plants. The new erection is 331
  feet in length, and 7 feet in width. It is divided into ten bays, with an ornamental centre
  projecting beyond the general line of the building. Each bay is subdivided by smaller bays, which
  are separated by glass pilasters; the glass sashes are so arranged that they can be removed in
  summer, and the whole thrown open to the gardens, whilst in winter the building affords an
  extensive promenade under cover. The ground on which this structure is built has a fall of 25 feet
  6 inches in its whole length; consequently, there is a proportionate fall at each bay, which gives
  great variety, and obviates the monotony that would be exhibited in a building of such length and
  dimensions placed on a uniform level. The lower side of each bay is finished by a glass pilaster,
  three feet in width, and surmounted by a vase on the wall behind. The roof is on the
  ridge-and-furrow principle, with the rafters on a very slight inclination; and the ventilation is
  effected in a similar but more perfect manner than that already described as in use at the
  conservatory at Darley Dale.</p>

  <p>"The new Victoria Regia House, which presents a light and novel appearance, is 60 feet 6 inches
  in length, and 46 feet 9 inches in breadth. Although, when compared with the Great Industrial
  Building, the Victoria House is a very diminutive structure, yet the principles on which it is
  constructed are the same, and may be carried out to an almost unlimited extent. The form of the
  roof, the general elevation, the supports, and the mode of construction, are all quite simple, and
  yet fully answer the purposes for which they were intended.</p>

  <p>"The Victoria House, however, was so built as to retain as much moisture and heat as possible,
  and yet to afford a strong and bright light at all seasons; whilst, on the contrary, the
  Industrial Building, being intended to accommodate a daily assemblage of many thousands of
  individuals, and a vast number of natural and mechanical productions, many of which would be
  destroyed by moisture and heat, is constructed so as fully to answer that end."</p>

  <p class="sp5">This, then, was the experience which enabled Mr. Paxton to conceive his design for
  the "Crystal Palace," a description of which as it has subsequently been carried out we must now
  proceed with.</p>

  alt="T"/>HE plan forms a parallelogram, 1,848 feet long and 408 feet wide, besides a projection on
  the north side, 48 feet wide and 936 feet long. A main avenue, 72 feet wide and 66 feet high,
  occupies the centre through the whole length of the building. Flanking this on either side are
  smaller avenues alternately 24 feet and 48 feet wide; the two first on either side of the centre
  are 43 feet, and the remainder 23 feet high. About the centre of the entire length, at a point
  determined by the position of a row of large trees, which it was resolved to inclose, these
  avenues are crossed by a transept of the same width as the main avenue, or 72 feet, and 108 feet
  high; two other groups of trees on the ground give occasion for open courts, which are inclosed
  within the building. The area thus inclosed and roofed over amounts to no less than 772,784 square
  feet, or about 19 acres;<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the building is, therefore,
  about four times the size of St. Peter's at Rome, and more than six times that of St. Paul's,
  London. Three entrances lead to this vast interior, one in the centre of the principal or south
  front, and one at either end of the building. The number of these is necessarily small, in order
  to facilitate the arrangements for the money-taking, and to avoid having too large a staff of
  officers; on the other hand, it was equally desirable to afford the most ample opportunities of
  egress for visitors, and accordingly fifteen exit doors are placed at frequent intervals.</p>

  <p>It will be well to mention here that the horizontal measure of 24 feet, which we have seen as
  the unit in the plan of the Building Committee, is also preserved in the present plan; every
  horizontal dimension of which is either a certain number of times or divisions of twenty-four
  feet.</p>

  <p>The avenues into which the plan is divided are formed by hollow cast-iron columns twenty-four
  feet apart, which rise in one, two, and three storeys respectively, to support the roof at the
  different heights given above; in the lower storey these columns are nineteen feet high, and in
  the two upper ones seventeen feet. Between the different lengths of the columns short pieces are
  introduced, called "connecting-pieces," from the office they perform; these are three feet long,
  and are so contrived that they serve to support girders in horizontal tiers, dividing the greatest
  height into three storeys as already mentioned. The girders, of which some are of cast and some of
  wrought iron, are all of the same depth, namely, three feet, with the exception of four, to be
  specially named hereafter, and by this arrangement the same horizontal lines are preserved
  throughout the whole of the building. They are also all similar in appearance, forming a kind of
  lattice-work, by which construction they do not look too heavy for the slight supports; and large
  solid masses are avoided, practically showing how great strength may be combined with elegance and
  lightness. The first or lower tier of these girders, in parts of the building more than one storey
  in height, forms the support for the floor of the galleries, which are twenty-four feet wide, and
  extend the whole length of the building in four parallel lines, intercepted only by the transept,
  round the ends of which they are continued. Numerous cross galleries connect each pair of
  longitudinal lines on either side of the centre avenue, which remains uninterrupted from end to
  end, and can only be crossed on the gallery-floor at the extremities.</p>

  <p>These galleries are reached by eight double staircases, of easy ascent and ample width, which
  are placed between the lines of gallery so as to communicate equally readily with either, and are
  so distributed as to give two to each quarter of the building; in the eastern or foreign half two
  supplementary staircases of smaller dimensions have been added.</p>

  <p>In those parts of the building more than two storeys in height, the second horizontal tier of
  girders does not support a gallery, but serves only to give stiffness to the columns. The upper
  tier of girders, in all cases, supports the roof, which is one of the most peculiar features in
  the structure. In its general form the roof is flat; but it is made up of a series of ridges and
  furrows, the rise and fall of which is but small, and is thus arranged: the roof-girders or
  trusses being twenty-four feet apart, and lying in the transverse direction of the building, the
  space between them is spanned by light beams or rafters, which are cambered or bent upwards, and
  are hollowed out in a groove on the top to form a gutter. The rafters are placed eight feet apart,
  their ends resting on the roof-girders, and lying, therefore, in the opposite direction to them,
  that is, in the direction <span class="pagenum" id="page36">{36}</span>of the length of the
  building; these rafters are commonly called the Paxton's Gutters. Between the rafters so
  described, <i>ridges</i> are supported by light sash-bars sloping up to them, at an inclination of
  two-and-a-half to one, and the rafter itself forms the bottom of the <i>furrow</i>. The advantage
  of this form of roofing is the facility it affords for the escape of the water, which runs from
  the surface of the roof into the Paxton's gutters; from them it is discharged into the main
  gutters resting on the roof-girders, by which it is conducted to the hollow columns, and passes
  down through them into the drains. A drop of water falling on the most distant point from the
  discharge would only have to traverse a distance of forty-eight feet; but in most cases the length
  to be passed over before reaching the down pipe would be considerably less.<a id="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The covering of the roof is glass, fixed between the sash-bars,
  which are grooved to receive it; and in order to carry off the moisture arising from condensation
  on the inner surface of the glass, the rafters have a small groove on each side, which makes the
  Paxton's gutter complete, and from which the moisture is also discharged into the main gutters.
  The essential portions of the roof may therefore be considered as a network of gutters; one set,
  the main gutters, lying in a transverse direction, and the others resting on them, and lying in
  the direction of the length of the building; by which arrangement any amount of surface can always
  be covered by roofing of a small span. The principle is precisely the same as that of subdividing
  large fields of arable land into strips or "lands" with furrows between them, in order to
  facilitate the surface-drainage.</p>

  <p>The outer inclosure, on the ground-floor, is formed by dividing each 24-feet bay between the
  columns into three 8-feet bays by half columns of wood, between which is placed boarding, held in
  its place by iron clips and bolts; a plinth, four feet high, is formed immediately above the floor
  by frames, filled with what are commonly called louvre-blades, which are hung on pivots, and of
  which a large number can be moved simultaneously for the admission of air; similar
  ventilating-frames, three feet deep, are introduced at the top of each storey round the entire
  circuit of the building, and by this means a ventilating-surface of no less than 40,800 square
  feet is obtained, or rather more than one acre.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Externally some light arches are inserted, and open panels form the inclosure for the upper
  louvre-frames. The details we have been describing may be readily traced in the engraving of a
  portion of the lower storey as seen from the outside. The exit doors occupy one of the 8-feet bays
  opening about six feet wide. The inclosure to the upper storeys closely resembles those of the
  ground-floor, but glazed sashes are substituted for the close boarding, and the plinth is omitted.
  Each storey is crowned externally with a cornice and cresting ornament, and over the columns posts
  are carried up, to which flagstaffs will be fixed.</p>

  <p>To return to the interior. The whole of the floor is boarded; that below is laid with an
  interval of half an inch between the boards, to allow the passage of dust from the millions of
  feet by which it will be trod; the gallery floor, on the contrary, has iron tongues between the
  boards to prevent the dust from coming through on the heads of the visitors below.</p>

  <p>The roof of the transept, which we have described as crossing the building about the centre of
  its length, differs from that of the other parts, its general form being semicircular instead of
  flat, and rising above the rest <span class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span>of the building so as
  to show the whole of the semicircle externally. This roof is supported by arched timber ribs
  placed twenty-four feet apart, or one over every column, which forms a socket, into which the foot
  of the rib is fitted and secured by iron straps. Between the ribs, timbers are fixed which carry
  minor ribs at a distance of eight feet apart, and upon these the ridge-and-furrow roofing is
  constructed in the manner that has been described for the flat roofing, but following the curve of
  the arched ribs. At the springing or foot of the arch on either side of the transept there is a
  range of louvre-frames to assist in the ventilation of the building, and on the top of the arch
  externally a narrow passage is formed to give access to the different parts of this roof. On the
  inner side of the arch diagonal tie-rods are introduced between the main ribs, which, while they
  serve to increase the strength of the construction by tying together all the parts from end to
  end, produce an agreeable play of lines forming a kind of network over the whole of the
  surface.</p>

  <p>The ends of the transept are closed in with fan-like tracery, reminding the spectator of the
  magnificent wheel windows of our Gothic cathedrals; this elegant feature is not visible in our
  interior view, but will be seen in some of the exteriors.</p>

  <p>There is, perhaps, no part of this interesting building in which the great size and singular
  lightness, almost airiness, of the construction are so strikingly displayed as in the <span
  class="smaller">TRANSEPT</span>, inclosing as it does a row of fine old elm-trees, as if to
  protect them in their venerable age from the smoke of the thousands of chimneys that have been
  gradually forming a destructive circle around them.</p>

  <p class="sp4">The only portion of solid untransparent roofing in the whole of this building is
  formed on either side of the arched roof just described, where there is a lead flat twenty-four
  feet wide. This was partly required for a platform to serve for carrying on the works for the
  arched roof, and was also exceedingly useful in giving access to the other roofs on either side;
  it likewise afforded the opportunity of giving some additional strength at the springing of the
  arched ribs to resist any possible tendency they might have to spread outwards.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span></div>

  <p>As the weight of such lead roofing considerably exceeds that of the glass ridge-and-furrow
  covering, it was necessary at the point where it crosses the wide span of the main avenue to
  introduce some stronger roof-girders than those used elsewhere; of these there are two on either
  side of the transept, the inner one of which has also to sustain two of the large arched ribs with
  their superincumbent roofing, and its strength is therefore increased in proportion to the
  additional load placed upon it. The extra-strong roof-girders are six feet deep, or twice that of
  the others; but their general construction is similar, the diagonal ties forming a kind of
  latticework, and thus keeping up the same character. These, like all the roof-girders of large
  span, are constructed principally of wrought-iron. Those who visited the building during its
  erection, and were among the fortunate few who were enabled to ascend to the "lead-flat," must
  have been very much struck with the singular appearance presented by the great expanse of acres of
  glass stretching in long lines of "ridge-and-furrow" roofing on each side of the centre, while the
  eye, penetrating the transparent covering, became lost in endeavouring to follow the apparently
  intricate lines of the interior. Such a view might fairly be said to justify the title of "Crystal
  Palace," by which this building is so commonly known; and it would require no great stretch of
  imagination to believe that it had been reared by fairy hands, as a votive offering at the world's
  jubilee of labour.</p>

  <p>But we must descend again to the interior, to point out the arrangement of the offices for the
  staff of the Executive. The principal of these are naturally placed in the centre, on either side
  of the principal entrance, where they occupy in two storeys the space underneath the gallery,
  which is continued uninterrupted over them. The entrances at the end are also flanked by offices
  of less extent. The outer inclosure of these spaces is formed with glazed sashes, similar to those
  which are placed on the exterior of the building, and boarded partitions divide the interior. The
  rooms are arranged to be heated and lighted by gas when required, and ample means of ventilation
  are provided.</p>

  <p>The simplicity of the construction renders it very easy to extend or contract the accommodation
  much more readily than would be possible under ordinary circumstances.</p>

  <p>It now remains to notice the arrangements provided for refreshments, which are introduced in
  connexion with the open courts left on account of the groups of trees. These happen to occur
  towards the ends of the building, and on the north side of the main avenue; the space at the north
  end of the transept, next to the inclosed trees, is also appropriated for this purpose. The
  roofing over these parts is a continuation of that over the rest of the building; and the
  partitions necessary for inclosing the different spaces are formed chiefly with glazed sashes,
  avoiding as much as possible any solid construction, which would appear out of character. The open
  courts are inclosed with sashes and doors, rendered necessary by the uncertain nature of our
  climate.</p>

  <p class="sp3">A small detached building which has not been mentioned serves for the boiler-house,
  and is placed near the west end of the building. As it had been determined to afford the means of
  exhibiting some of the machinery in actual motion, it was necessary to erect boilers to supply the
  steam to the different machines, as it would clearly be inadmissible for each to generate steam
  for its own use in the building. The house to contain the boilers is ninety-six feet long and
  twenty-four feet wide, and is placed as near as practicable to the machinery-department; but at
  the same time it is quite detached from the main building to avoid risk from the fires. In
  appearance it resembles the one-storey portion of the main building, but it is constructed
  entirely of fire-proof materials. It contains five boilers, each to supply steam for twenty-horse
  power, which is distributed by a pipe to the different machinery.</p>

  <p>An ornamental cast-iron railing designed by Mr. Owen Jones incloses the building, being placed
  at a distance of about eight feet from it along the principal fronts, but carried much further off
  at the ends, so as to inclose a considerable space, which will thus be available for exhibiting
  any large objects that will bear exposure to the weather, if there should not be sufficient room

  construction, of which the essential parts are few in number compared with the great repetition of
  each individually. To assist in this multiplied reproduction of the same form, some exceedingly
  ingenious machinery has been employed, which will therefore be described in connexion with the
  parts it has been used to form; and thus these will be traced through their various stages, from
  the raw material to their finished state as portions of the building. The greater part of this

  different portions of the roof, with which we will therefore commence.</p>

  has been mentioned that the rafters which span the space between the roof-girders serve, at the
  same time, as gutters, for which purpose they are hollowed out on the upper face, besides having
  smaller grooves at the sides to take the condensation-water. The bottom of the gutter is of a
  circular form, which is universally considered the best for conveying liquids with the least
  amount of friction, and therefore the least liable to obstruction from an accumulation of
  dirt.</p>

  <p>A section of the gutter, as finished, is shown. To bring it into this form, after the timbers
  had been sawn into the requisite general dimensions they were brought under the action of the
  planing-machine, where they were planed on the four sides. This machine is patented by W. Furness,
  of Liverpool, and was worked at the Chelsea Wharf Saw-mills. The operation was effected by cutters
  (<i>a</i>) attached to the ends of an arm revolving with great rapidity in a horizontal plane; the
  timbers to be planed were wedged up into a frame (<i>b</i>) traversing on rails, and as this was
  passed under the revolving cutters the upper surface was removed by them, at the same time the
  timbers were held down upon the frame by a large iron disc (<i>c</i>) pressing upon their upper
  surface. The disc, together with the revolving arm carrying the cutters, was capable of being
  adjusted vertically to the exact dimensions of the timber. The traversing-frame was slowly
  propelled by the machinery, and three widths of timber were operated upon at one time. On leaving
  the planing-machine these quarter baulks were passed on to the gutter-cutting machine. Four
  different cutters were required to form the section, as shown above; they were placed one behind
  the other, so that the piece of timber, which was presented to their action above the centre of
  motion, passed over each of them in succession. The first set, which revolved in a vertical plane,
  roughly hollowed out the larger groove to the section shown in Fig. 1; the two next were
  counterparts, and formed the same <span class="pagenum" id="page42">{42}</span>section in opposite
  directions; they were set at an inclination to the upright of about 45 degrees, the one to the
  right, the other to the left; and each hollowed out one of the small side grooves, and one side of
  the larger gutter, leaving the section of the timber respectively of the forms shown in Figs. 2
  and 3. Fig. 4 shows the form of its section after it had passed both; the fourth set of cutters
  again revolved vertically, and gave the gutter its finished form, as shown above. As the timber
  passed over the cutters it was supported at the ends on revolving rollers, and was held in its
  place by guiding grooves, being pressed gradually forwards against the cutters.</p>

  <p>In this manner forty-two lengths of solid gutter, each twenty-four feet and a fraction long,
  were completed in a day of ten hours; and as the machine was worked double time, a length of more
  than 2,000 feet was turned out daily ready for use: this, it has been calculated, would have
  required the labour of about three hundred men to be employed for the same length of time. The
  absolute necessity for such rapid production will be evident when it is known that no less than
  110,000 feet, or about twenty miles length, of such gutters were required&mdash;very nearly the
  distance from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle.</p>

  <p>Finished as described above, the Paxton's gutters arrived at the building, where the first
  operation they underwent was that of cutting them to the exact length requisite. This was a nice
  operation, as the smallest deviation would have caused a difficulty in fitting them into their
  place, and to perform it a framework was constructed by which the solid gutter could <span
  class="pagenum" id="page43">{43}</span>be bent to the same curve it would have when fixed; a
  precaution that was necessary in order that the ends might be cut off quite vertically so as to
  fit together when in their place. At one end of this frame-work was placed a circular saw, twenty
  inches diameter, hung with a pulley and balance weight, so as to be moved up and down by means of
  a lever. The gutter being fixed in the frame by means of hinged guage-plates, one end was cut by
  the circular saw being brought down upon it; and at the same time another operation was performed:
  two cutters, placed in the centre of the circular saw, were so arranged that when brought down
  upon the end of the solid gutter they cut out a semi-circular notch, so that when the ends of two
  gutters were afterwards placed together there was a circular hole left, through which the water
  passed down into the main gutter. When these operations were completed at one end of the gutter,
  the guage-plates were taken off, and the timber was swung round on a pivot or crutch in the
  centre, and the same process gone through as before; the whole scarcely occupying two minutes. We
  shall presently have to return to this piece of machinery, as it was also used in finishing the
  ridge rafters.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The solid gutter was now transferred to the hands of the carpenter, who fixed at
  each end, on the under-side, a small cast-iron shoe; and two struts, nine inches long, were placed
  so as to divide the whole length into three equal parts&mdash;the struts spread out at the top in
  order to present a large surface of pressure against the under-side of the gutter; and tenons
  projected upwards, which were fitted into mortices cut into the timber. The lower end of the
  struts were formed so as to give them a firm hold upon a wrought-iron rod, thirteen-sixteenths of
  an inch diameter, which was passed under them and through the shoes, where it was screwed up with
  nuts; and the struts pressing up against the timber produced the requisite bend or camber.
  Twenty-seven notches, to receive the sash bars, were marked with a templet and cut out on each
  edge of the upper-side of the gutter; and a small cast-iron plate having been fitted on the
  under-side at each end, the Paxton's gutter was complete and ready for fixing. The under-trussing
  of the rafters increased their strength considerably, so that a weight of one-and-a-half tons was
  required to break one which was experimented upon.</p>

  will next consider the sash-bars which support the ridge of the roof and receive the glass. The
  total length which was required of these amounts to about two hundred miles; it will, therefore,
  be easily understood that mechanical contrivance for cutting them out became an absolute
  necessity; this Mr. Paxton appears to have discovered in his works at Chatsworth, as he mentions
  in his lecture.</p>

  <p>The sash-bars are one inch thick and one-and-a-half inches deep, and are grooved on each side,
  besides having all the four edges bevelled or chamfered; all which was done in one passage through
  the machine. The plank which was to form the sash-bars was passed in at one end of the machine,
  between pressure-rollers; it then passed between cutters placed both above and below it, which
  made about twelve hundred revolutions per minute, and hollowed out the different grooves; and,
  lastly, it passed between circular saws which divided it into separate sash-bars, after which they
  had only to be cut into their proper lengths.<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The
  exact length of each sash-bar when finished is four feet one inch.</p>

  <p>In this state the skylight bars were sent to the building, where they underwent several
  finishing operations, necessary to make the ends fit down into the notches prepared in the ridges
  and gutters. Thirty of the bars <span class="pagenum" id="page45">{45}</span>were first placed
  together in a horizontal traversing-frame on a saw-table, on each side of which circular saws were
  fixed at the distance of the required length of the sash-bar; the frame was then moved forward
  against the saws, so that both ends of the whole set of bars were cut off simultaneously, and at
  the same time a cut was made at one end half-way through the bar, in order to form the shoulder
  against the gutter. They were then removed to another bench, where the end of the bar was bevelled
  and the shoulder formed by means of a small instrument having a handle with two projecting jaws
  fitting into the ends of the glass grooves of the bars; between these there was a small blade
  which, being pressed down, cut out the shoulder which had been sawn through in the other
  direction, and another blade was placed at the proper angle to remove the bevelled piece at the
  end of the bar.</p>

  <p>One more process made the sash-bars complete for fixing&mdash;this was the drilling a hole at
  each end to nail them down on the gutter and ridge; and this was also done by machinery, to insure
  all the holes being drilled at the same angle. On one side of a horizontal bench were placed a set
  of four-inch driving pulleys (<i>a a</i>), with as many horizontal drills projecting towards the
  other side of the bench; a wooden traversing-plate (<i>c</i>) opposite each drill, and working
  towards it, received one end of the sash-bar, while the other rested in an inclined position
  against a wooden rail (<i>b</i>) placed longitudinally above the pulleys, having as many sinkings
  thereon as there were drills. The traversing-plate being then pushed forward, the sash-bar was
  perforated by the drill; the plate was then drawn back, and the same operation repeated with the
  other end of the bar, which left it ready for fixing.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page46">{46}</span></div>

  <p>The action of the traversing-plate (<i>c</i>) is shown more distinctly in the second

  total length of these required was about sixteen miles. They are cut out of timber three inches
  square, in section, and are of the form shown in the diagram, with a groove on each side to
  receive the glass. This was also done by machinery which, with about five-horse power, turned out
  one hundred lengths of twenty-four feet in a day of ten hours, allowing the time for the necessary
  stoppages. After they had been delivered at the building, these ridge-pieces were cut to the exact
  lengths by means of the same apparatus used for the solid gutters which has already been
  described. At each end of the ridge-piece two holes were also drilled to receive dowells to
  connect it with the adjoining length. By no other than mechanical means could the immense number
  of holes thus drilled have been placed so exactly that those in the opposite ends of any two
  ridge-pieces should correspond precisely.</p>

  on an average about one-sixteenth of an inch thick, and weighing one pound per foot superficial.
  This gives an aggregate weight of about four hundred tons for the whole of the work, <span
  class="pagenum" id="page47">{47}</span>the greater part of which was supplied by Messrs. Chance
  and Co., of Birmingham. Each square is forty-nine inches long and ten wide, the greatest length of
  sheet glass that has ever been made in this country. The manufacture of this kind of glass is of
  comparatively recent introduction into England, though practised for some time on the Continent;
  and the rapid progress made by the manufacturers alluded to must be in a great measure attributed
  to the wise removal of the fiscal burden on the article, made by the late Sir Robert Peel. That
  lamented statesman, with his usual foresight, doubtless contemplated that great social benefits
  would follow from that enactment; and it is, perhaps, not too much to say that, but for Sir
  Robert's enlightened measure, this "huge pile of transparency" would never have been reared.</p>

  which are grooved two upright sides, they are firmly bolted down upon the upper flange of the
  roof-girders, and where these are quite horizontal the fall in the gutter is given by a false
  bottom laid to a slope. Of these gutters there is a length of about five-and-a-half miles in the
  building, which, added to the aggregate length of the Paxton's gutters, makes a total of about
  twenty-five-and-a-half miles of gutter.</p>

  alt="T"/>HESE are of cast-iron, where not more than twenty-four feet long, and the rest of
  wrought-iron. The cast-iron ones are precisely the same in appearance as those used for the
  galleries, but lighter in metal; a separate description of them is not, therefore, necessary. The
  weight of each of these girders is twelve cwt., and each was proved to nine tons previously to
  being used; but it is calculated that the greatest weight they may have to bear will not exceed
  five tons: the total number required was about 470.</p>

  <p>The wrought-iron girders, or trusses, are partly forty-eight and partly seventy-two feet long,
  to span the avenues of those respective widths; the principle of the construction is the same in
  each. The top rail (if it may be so called) of the truss is formed with two pieces of <img
  src="images/cs1.png" style="width:0.9em;" alt="L section"/> iron placed back to back <img
  src="images/cs2.png" style="width:2.0em;" alt="double L sections"/>, and the bottom rail with two
  flat bars <img src="images/cs3.png" style="width:1.1em;" alt="parallel flat bars"/>, the total
  depth being three feet; at the ends these bars are riveted on to cast-iron standards, and the
  intermediate distance is divided into eight-feet lengths by other cast-iron standards, to which
  the bars are also riveted, <span class="pagenum" id="page48">{48}</span>and thus a framework of
  rectangles is formed. In the trusses forty-eight feet span there are, therefore, six such
  divisions in the length, and nine in those of seventy-two feet span. These are then divided in the
  direction of <span class="smaller">ONE</span> of the diagonals by a flat bar passing between and
  riveted to those forming the top and bottom rails. This completes the constructional part of the
  truss; but to render the appearance more uniform with that of the cast-iron girders, a flat bar of
  wood (shown by the dotted lines) is made to form the other diagonal of the rectangles.</p>

  <p>The trusses for a span of seventy-two feet are cambered or bent upwards about ten inches, which
  both adds to their strength and improves the appearance. The form and arrangement of these
  roof-trusses may be clearly traced in several of the views of the interior which are presented to
  the reader. The weight, when completed, of each of the trusses of seventy-two feet span is about
  thirty-five cwt., and of those of forty-eight feet span about thirteen cwt.</p>

  <p>It has been already mentioned that four of the roof-trusses vary from the rest on account of
  the greater load they have to sustain. The depth of these exceptional trusses is six feet, and
  their length seventy-two feet, or the width of the main avenue, which they bridge over. The
  principle of their construction is similar to that employed in the lighter trusses; but the
  arrangement of the parts is somewhat modified. The top rail consists of two pieces of <img
  src="images/cs1.png" style="width:0.9em;" alt="L section"/> iron, placed, as before, back to back;
  but they are further connected on the top by a flat piece <img src="images/cs4.png"
  style="width:2.2em;" alt="double L sections with flat"/>. The lower rail is formed by two flat
  bars placed upright <img src="images/cs3.png" style="width:1.1em;" alt="parallel flat bars"/>, and
  these are riveted at the ends to standards of cast-iron, which, however, are considerably heavier
  in construction than those before described; and they have also in the centre, at (<i>a</i>) two
  slots, or sinkings, into which the ends of two of the diagonal bars are riveted. The whole length
  is then divided into three equal parts, each 24 feet long, by strong <span
  class="smaller">CAST</span>-iron standards at (<i>b</i>) the ends of which are riveted between the
  rails, and these spaces are again subdivided into three eight-feet lengths by <span
  class="smaller">WROUGHT</span>-iron standards at (<i>c c</i>). The top of each standard is next
  connected with the foot of the next but one to it by diagonal flat bars, which, together with the
  short pieces fastened into the slots at (<i>a</i>), complete the figure of the whole, forming a
  kind of trellis-work, two diamonds in depth. In the diagram only half the length of the girder is
  shown.</p>

  <p>The dimensions of the different bars of iron in this piece of construction <span
  class="pagenum" id="page49">{49}</span>are proportional to the amount of strain they have to bear.
  The two heavier out of the four trusses just described weighed when completed eight tons each, and
  the other two, which are of rather lighter construction, six tons each.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The riveting together of the wrought-iron trusses was performed on horizontal
  supports, on which the curve that they were to be made to was marked out. The bars having been
  previously cut to the requisite lengths, and punched and drilled with holes for the rivets, were
  laid out on the stages in the proper forms with the cast-iron standards, which were temporarily
  kept in place by bolts passed through some of the rivet-holes. The whole framework was then
  riveted up with red-hot rivets supplied from small portable furnaces, several sets of men being
  employed upon each truss, by which means as many as sixteen were completed in one day. The whole
  of the trusses, three hundred and seventy-two in number, required for the building were put
  together on the ground, and several ingenious mechanical contrivances were made use of to
  facilitate and hasten the work. To form some idea of the amount of labour that had to be
  performed, it may be mentioned that each of the trusses forty-eight feet in length, or the
  smallest, is held together by more than fifty rivets, requiring more than twice that number of
  holes to be made in bars of iron varying in thickness from a quarter of an inch upwards. About

  holes for the rivets were made partly by drilling and partly by punching. In the machine used for
  the former the bar to be bored was laid upon a flat surface forming part of the solid cast-iron
  stand of the machinery; the drilling-point worked vertically, and could be moved in that direction
  to suit the different thicknesses of iron brought under its operation. It was suspended at one end
  of a lever, with a counterpoise at the other. This lever was also connected by a rod and crank,
  with another near the ground, one end of which was formed into a tread to be worked by the foot.
  The workman, when he had arranged the iron in the right position under the drill, pressed his foot
  upon the tread; thus raising the counterpoise end of the upper lever, and pressing the point of
  the drill, which was of a spear-head form, down upon the iron. Underneath the iron to be drilled
  was placed a piece of wood to protect the point of the drill when it had passed through the iron.
  It was also necessary to moisten the iron during the operation, in order to keep the drill-point
  cool. Three men were required to attend to this work, which was not so rapid as the other method
  of making the holes by punching.</p>

  enormous power exerted by this piece of machinery renders it necessary that the stand containing
  the punch, &amp;c., should be exceedingly solid, and it is formed accordingly by a heavy mass of
  cast-iron, in which there are two indentations, as seen by the engraving. In the lower of these
  the punching operation is performed, and in the <span class="pagenum" id="page51">{51}</span>upper
  there are shears for cutting off the ends of the bars when required. The motion is communicated to
  each of these by means of a cogged wheel at the back; but both the punch and the shears work in a
  vertical direction, slowly moving up and down with irresistible force. There is no sudden blow or
  jerk, which makes the effect the more striking, as the unpractised eye has no means of discovering
  the amount of the force which is being put in operation. It is, however, so great that, although
  the punching of a hole scarcely occupies two or three seconds, the iron becomes quite hot from the
  effect of the pressure. In using this machine, the workman arranges the iron bar on a solid rest,
  placing it so that when the punch descends it makes the hole in the position required. As soon as
  the punch has passed through the bar, the action of the machinery is reversed, and the instrument
  ascends again; during which time the bar is re-arranged, and the operation is thus continually
  repeated. This piece of machinery also requires three men to work it, if the bars to be punched
  are of considerable length, so as to require the ends to be held up; otherwise, one alone is
  sufficient; and in the course of a ten-hours day about three thousand holes can be punched
  out&mdash;the number, of course, varying according to the thickness of the bars.</p>

  the Chelsea Saw-mills, where the reader has already seen the Paxton's gutters shaped out, another
  interesting piece of machinery was in use for these works, for the purpose of finishing planks to
  a certain size and thickness, called the adzing and planing machine. An adze is a tool used by
  carpenters to remove any unevenness in the surface of a board in a particular spot. In this piece
  of machinery two cutters are fixed to a revolving arm, under which the plank is made to pass; and
  as it does so the cutters remove a certain thickness from the whole of the surface. The
  arrangement of these cutters is very plainly shown in the annexed engraving. On the under-side of
  the same bench to which this apparatus is fixed, three planes are set, each at an angle of about 5
  degrees, by which the under-side of the plank <span class="pagenum" id="page52">{52}</span>is
  brought to an even face, while the upper surface is operated on by the adzing-cutters, and in this
  manner the plank is reduced to an even thickness throughout. As it passes on it is brought between
  two circular saws, which are adjusted to the width which it is desired to give to the plank. It is
  dragged forward towards the planes and cutters by means of an endless chain, composed of open
  links; which chain passes over a wheel provided with projecting pegs, so arranged as to fit into
  the links. The plank is kept down upon the planes, and otherwise held in position, by
  pressure-rollers.</p>

  columns in the building perform three important offices. They support the roof and the galleries,
  and serve as pipes to convey the rain-water from the roofs. Their form, which is beautiful, both
  mechanically and artistically, was suggested by Mr. Barry; it is a ring, eight inches in diameter
  externally, the thickness varying in the different columns, according to the weights they have to
  support respectively. Four flat faces, about three inches wide, are added on the outside of this
  ring, so that when the column is in its place, they face nearly north, south, east, and west. The
  column may therefore be considered as a hollow tube, of the section just described, and of the
  same form at each end, having at its extremities horizontally projecting rings called <span
  class="smaller">SNUGS</span>, through which the bolts are passed, to fasten the columns to the
  connecting-pieces and base-pieces. That the hollow form adopted for the columns is that best
  suited to obtain the greatest strength with the least amount of material has been <span
  class="pagenum" id="page53">{53}</span>abundantly shown by experiments, as even two straws placed
  in an upright position will bear a very considerable weight; it is that also seen in the structure
  of the bones of animals. Of these columns there are 3,300 in the whole building.</p>

  <p>Those portions of the height of the columns which correspond with the depth and position of the
  girders form separate lengths, which are called connecting-pieces, as they unite the lengths of
  columns of the different storeys. These connecting-pieces have the same sectional form as the
  columns themselves, and, like them, are the same at each end, where there are projections cast on,
  which serve to support the girders, and which are provided with holes through which the bolts pass
  to connect them with the columns. These holes alternate with the projections to receive the
  girders, which projections are so formed that they clip others cast on to the ends of the girders,
  which will be hereafter described. In the centre of each projection there is formed a small notch
  which receives the key or wedge for fixing the girders.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The meeting faces of the columns and connecting-pieces were all turned in a lathe,
  in order that, when set up, they might fit so precisely as not to require any packing to adjust
  them in an upright position; and only in the cases of those columns which serve as water-pipes is
  any such packing introduced. In those a piece of canvass, with white lead, is put into the joint.
  An enormous amount of additional labour was involved by this proceeding, as no less than twelve
  hundred of such faces had to be operated on; but this did not deter the enterprising contractors,
  who were fully alive to the importance of the object to be attained. When fixed, the projecting
  "snugs," with the bolts passing through them, were covered by ornamental caps and bases of
  cast-iron, fixed after the rest of the work was completed.</p>

  lower storey of columns in every case stands upon base-pieces of which the upright portion is a
  continuation of the column, with "snugs" at the top, to correspond with those of the column, and
  standing on a horizontal bed-plate, from which "shoulders" rise to strengthen the upright portion.
  These bed-plates vary in size from three feet by two feet to one foot six inches by one foot, in
  proportion to the weight which the several superincumbent columns have to sustain. The longest
  dimension of the bed-plate is in the transverse direction of the building, in which the greatest
  overturning strain might be expected to act upon the columns. From the vertical portion of the
  base-pieces, sockets six inches in diameter project, in the direction of the length of the
  building, into which are fitted the <span class="pagenum" id="page54">{54}</span>cast-iron
  drain-pipes, which convey away the water brought down by the columns from the roof. The height of
  the base-pieces varies to suit the different levels at which the floor is supported above the
  ground. These levels had therefore to be determined in every individual instance previous to the
  castings being made. It was done, however, with such precision that, when they came to be used,
  they were all found to be of the exact length required for their situation. Of these base-pieces,
  1,074 were required for the building.</p>

  has been mentioned that the columns supported girders at three different heights, dividing the
  greatest altitude of the building into three storeys; and that the lower tier of girders, where
  the building consisted of more than one storey, served to support a gallery.</p>

  <p>These gallery girders are all twenty-four feet long and three feet deep, the upper and lower
  "flanges" or rails having a <img src="images/cs5.png" style="width:0.9em;" alt="T section"/>
  formed section with standards at the ends of similar section. The rectangular space between them
  is then divided into three equal parts, by uprights having a <img src="images/cs6.png"
  style="width:1.4em;" alt="+ section"/> form of section, and the three smaller spaces thus obtained
  have diagonal "struts" in each direction. The girder thus described forms a double truss, in which
  the diagonal braces are subjected both to the strain of compression and tension. At the top and
  bottom of the end-standards small projections are cast on, by which the connecting-pieces hold the
  girders; and at each end of the flat portion of the top and bottom rails small sinkings are cast,
  by means of which the girder is keyed up to its position. The flat portion of the upper and lower
  "flanges" of the girder is swelled out in width from the ends towards the centre, in order to
  increase the quantity of metal in that part where the strain is greatest.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The description just given of the gallery girders will apply to all the cast-iron
  girders throughout the building, of which there are 2,150; the only difference between them being,
  that those for the roofs or other internal portions, where no gallery is to be supported, are cast
  with a less amount of metal. The form of girder just described, which is unusual, was the result
  of several experiments performed under the superintendence of Messrs. W. Cubitt, C. H. Wild, C.
  Fox, and other gentlemen, previous to the commencement of the building; and the thickness of metal
  for the different parts of these, as well as for all the other cast-iron work in the building, was
  minutely calculated and determined by Mr. C. H. Wild and Mr. C. Fox, under the supervision of Mr.
  Cubitt, the President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, to whom the Royal Commission had
  intrusted the responsible duty of the chief superintendence of the whole of the work.</p>

  proceed to the gallery itself, supported by the girders just described. The timbers supporting the
  floor are so arranged that the weight of each bay of twenty-four feet square is distributed
  equally to the four girders inclosing it, and in such a manner as to bear upon them at the points
  immediately over the vertical standards.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In the transverse direction of the building two pairs of joists, eight feet apart
  in each bay, are formed into trusses by tie-rods, 1&#x215C; inches diameter, passed through a
  cast-iron shoe at each end, and pressing up two "struts," which are made to bear against the
  under-side of binding-timbers running longitudinally, or crossing the joists, and immediately
  under them. The cast-iron shoes for the trusses are bolted down to the girders, and serve at the
  same time to receive the standard supports of the gallery railing. The ends of the binding-timbers
  are secured by bolts and oak suspension-pieces to the other two girders inclosing the square.
  Joists about two feet six inches apart bear from girder to girder parallel to the trusses, and
  resting on the binding-timbers. On these is laid the floor, 1¼ inches thick, grooved and
  iron-tongued. A light cast-iron railing, forming a kind of trellis-work, is fixed between the
  columns, and is capped with a round mahogany hand-rail. From the view at page 60 the arrangement
  of the galleries will be readily understood.</p>

  alt="F"/>ROM the very important office which the girders perform throughout the building, but more
  particularly those supporting the galleries, it was of the utmost importance that, previously to
  their being fixed in their places, the soundness of the casting should be proved; for it could
  hardly be expected that so large a number of girders could be produced without some of them being
  defective. The ordinary means of testing girders, by loading them with weights, would have
  occupied far too much time; and therefore an ingenious apparatus was devised by Mr. C. H. Wild for
  this purpose, by the use of which the testing of a girder occupied but a few minutes.</p>

  <p>It consisted of a very strong cast-iron frame rather longer than the girder, the bottom of
  which was formed by two fixed beams placed eight inches apart, and supported a few inches above
  the ground. At each end of these a cast-iron standard was firmly bolted between them and rose to a
  height rather greater than the depth of the girder to be tested; on the inner faces of these
  standards two "shoulders" were formed, which received the projections cast on the ends of the
  girder, as before mentioned. Between the fixed beams below, at two points dividing the whole
  length into three equal parts, were placed strong cylinders, with rising pistons connected with a
  forcing-pump, together with which they formed a Bramah's hydraulic press. A girder being placed in
  this frame, in an inverted position, the force applied by means of the pistons rising from the
  cylinders acted upon it precisely at those points, and in the same manner, as the load from the
  gallery or the roof would do when afterwards fixed in its place.</p>

  <p>The essential parts of the Bramah's press may be thus briefly described. It consists of two
  cylinders, the diameter of one being considerably larger than that of the other. The smaller
  cylinder is fitted with a solid plunger or piston, by means of which water may be forced from it
  into the larger; this being also fitted with a rising piston, the force is communicated by it to
  the weight which it is desired to raise. The power obtained by means of this apparatus arises from
  the distributive power of fluids and the practical incompressibility of water, and it is
  proportioned to the difference of the diameters of the two cylinders; so that if a pressure of one
  pound per square inch be applied on the surface of the piston in the smaller cylinder, and the
  piston in the larger cylinder present a surface ten times greater, the power is multiplied by that
  number; whilst, in addition, the lever power used in applying the pressure to the smaller piston
  is obtained. The <span class="pagenum" id="page57">{57}</span>cylinders are fitted with valves, so
  arranged as to prevent the return of the water from the larger to the smaller, while the apparatus
  is in action, and thus the power is accumulated in the former.</p>

  <p>In the instance before us, the two 3-inch cylinders already alluded to in the proving-frame
  took the place of the larger cylinder of the ordinary apparatus; and they were connected with the
  forcing-pump by a strong metal tube. When a girder had been fixed in the frame for proving, the
  force-pump was worked till the pistons underneath the girder carried it off its lower bearings and
  pressed it upwards against the "shoulders," by which it was firmly held, and the pressure was then
  continued until the amount previously fixed upon as necessary for proof had been obtained. This
  was ascertained by means of a self-adjusting apparatus attached to the hydraulic press.</p>

  <p>An iron cylinder 1½ inches diameter was placed in communication with the pipe connecting the
  pump and the press, so that the pressure obtained in it was, in proportion to its diameter, the
  same as that in the large cylinder; and it was fitted with a piston-rod, working in a vertical
  direction. This piston-rod was connected with a lever, from the end of which a scale-pan was
  suspended, at a distance from the fulcrum ten times greater than that of the point of attachment
  of the piston from the same. The weight of the scale-pan and lever were balanced by a large mass
  of iron at the other end. In the scale-pan a certain weight was placed, proportioned to the proof
  desired to be obtained; and the action of the pump was continued until the water, rising in the
  iron cylinder just described, forced up the lever, and with it the weight attached; and thus
  indicated that the pressure to which it was desired to subject the girder had been reached. The
  weight to be placed in the scale-pan was thus determined: the diameter of the lever cylinder being
  1½ inches, and that of each of those in the proving-frame three inches, the pistons or "rams" in
  the latter presented together eight times the surface of that in the lever cylinder; which being
  multiplied by the difference of length of the two parts of the lever, determines the weight for
  the scale-pan to be one-eightieth of that to which it was desired to prove the girder.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The ordinary gallery girders were tested with a pressure equivalent to a weight of
  fifteen tons; but it was calculated that, when fixed, the greatest weight they would have to
  sustain would be seven-and-a-half tons. In one instance, for the sake of experiment, the pressure
  was continued beyond the proof weight of fifteen tons, to see what amount of strain the girders
  would bear without fracture, and it was found that a strain of thirty tons produced no injurious
  effect; but the girder broke with an additional weight of half a ton.</p>

  will now return to describe that portion of the roof which varies in form and arrangement from the
  rest, namely, the semicircular covering of the transept. This is supported by arched ribs, placed
  twenty-four feet apart, and constructed of Memel timber, in three thicknesses; the centre-piece
  four inches thick, with a 2-inch piece on each side of it. They are formed in lengths of about
  nine feet, placed so as to break joint; that is, the joints of the outer pieces fall upon the
  centre of the inner one. The thicknesses are fastened together by bolts passing through them about
  two feet six inches apart, besides being nailed at other points. On the inner circumference of the
  rib thus constructed there is then placed a piece of timber moulded to correspond with the form of
  the columns; and on the outer circumference two boards, each one inch thick, are bent round and
  attached to the rib with strong nails. On both the outer and inner circumference a flat bar of
  iron is secured by bolts passing through the whole depth of the rib, which, thus finished,
  measures eighteen inches in depth by eight inches in thickness. The ends of the ribs are fitted
  into sockets, formed by the upward continuation of the columns, to which they are attached by iron
  straps.</p>

  <p>The ribs, which are supported by the trusses over the main avenue, have their ends bolted down
  upon a piece of timber secured on the upper portion of the truss; and they are further fixed in
  their places by oak brackets, forming a spreading foot on each side upon the same piece of
  timber.</p>

  <p>Between these large ribs horizontal timbers, called "purlins," are fixed about nine feet apart,
  by means of cast-iron shoes, bolted both to them and to the ribs. These serve to support the minor
  or intermediate ribs, occurring at distances of eight feet apart; which consist of a single square
  piece of timber, having the two thicknesses of 1-inch board bent round their outer circumference,
  as on the main ribs. The boards form the gutters or furrows between which rise the ridges, in the
  same manner as in that portion of the roof which is horizontal.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The ridges, in this case, instead of being cut out of solid pieces, are formed in
  three thicknesses, bent round to the requisite curve, and so retained by small bolts tying them
  down to the "purlins." The sash-bars which receive the glass form, as elsewhere, the sloping
  rafters or supports of the ridge.</p>

  three quarters of an inch in diameter, having eyes at one end, by means of which they are secured

  horizontal truss is formed by flat bars of iron fixed in the direction of the diagonal of the
  24-feet square bays, to resist any possible thrust or tendency of the ends of the ribs to open

  external inclosures of the building, on the levels of the different storeys, require but little
  description in detail beyond that already given. The sash-bars dividing the sashes of the upper
  tiers are grooved for glass similarly to those used in the roof, and were cut out by the same
  machinery. The glass was put in after they were framed together, so that it was necessary to
  arrange the ends of the bars that it could be slipped in at one end. As the bars of these sashes
  were of slight dimensions and considerable length, they were strengthened by wrought-iron rods
  passed through the sash-frame and the bars, and screwed up at the ends, causing the whole to work
  together. The sashes are held in their position by small cast-iron clips, which are bolted on to
  the columns; and as the surface presented to the wind by the upright sides of the building is of
  such considerable extent, wooden bridges are fixed against the sashes on the inside, by small
  cast-iron shoes bolted to the columns; and at the internal angles, where the wind would exert its
  greatest force, these bridges are further strengthened by wrought-iron rods half an inch in
  diameter, pressing against the back of them, which is grooved for the purpose, and screwed up at
  each end in the cast-iron shoes. In this manner a connected chain of resistance to any external
  pressure is established round the whole circuit of the building.</p>

  structures considerably add to their stability, it was thought desirable to introduce into the
  construction something to compensate for this deficiency. At several points in the length of the
  building, where a continuous connexion could be established transversely, the squares formed by
  the columns and girders on the different storeys have their four corners connected by diagonal
  rods, seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, having eyes at the ends, by which they are secured to
  the bolts connecting the different parts of the columns. In the centre of the square the four rods
  meet in a cast-iron ring, and are screwed up with nuts; ornamental faces are fitted into the
  rings, so that this addition to the construction is by no means detrimental to the general
  effect.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In a similar manner this diagonal bracing is introduced in a horizontal direction
  immediately under the floor of some portions of the galleries; of these there are twenty-two sets,

  their introduction will be readily understood from the views of the interior.</p>

  double staircases, of which it has been mentioned there are eight in the building, consist each of
  four flights, about eight feet wide; two parallel ones, leading from the ground-floor to a
  landing, at the half-height, and the other two branching in opposite directions from the landing
  to the two galleries. The treads of the steps are <span class="pagenum"
  id="page61">{61}</span>made of a species of mahogany called sabicu, which is much harder than oak,
  and therefore peculiarly suited to the purpose for which it is here employed. The risers, or faces
  of the steps, are of deal. The stairs are supported by cast-iron girders, following the slope, the
  lower ones being fixed at the foot to stout timbers under the flooring, and the upper ends bolted
  to the cast-iron columns which support the landing. These columns are of the same pattern as the
  rest throughout the building, but only five inches in diameter. They are supported on concrete,
  and eight of them are required for each staircase. The floor of the landing is carried by lesser
  cast-iron girders, with flooring-joists.</p>

  <p>The girders carrying the upper flights spring from the landing girders, and have their upper
  ends bolted on to the main girders supporting the galleries, which are varied in pattern for this
  purpose. The railing of the staircase is formed in separate cast-iron standards, one to each step,
  which are bolted on to the top flange of the girders; and the foot of the standard is so continued
  that the ends of the treads are fitted into it, and are thus supported. The pattern of these
  standards is assimilated to that of the gallery railing.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The hand-rail is formed of Honduras mahogany, with carved ends. On each side of the
  upper flight, which occupies the centre of a 24-feet space, connecting-galleries about eight feet
  wide are carried, establishing a communication between the two lines of gallery without descending
  to the level of the landing and then re-ascending. The landing is sufficiently high above the
  ground-floor to give ample headway for passing underneath it; so that the space occupied by the
  staircases on the ground-floor is but small.</p>

  now only remains to mention briefly the construction of the floor of the building, and the
  foundations for the base-pieces. The substratum of the site consists of gravel of an excellent
  quality, and sufficiently dense to have sustained, perhaps without any preparation, the load
  brought upon it by the bases of the columns. A thickness of concrete, proportioned in all cases to
  the amount of the weight to be borne by the superincumbent columns, and of such a size as to be
  two feet in each direction larger than the bed-plates, was placed upon the gravel, and the upper
  surface was finished with a bed of fine mortar to receive the bed-plates. In this manner it was
  calculated that in no case would a greater weight than two-and-a-half tons be borne by each foot
  superficial of the gravel&mdash;previous experiments having shown that a considerably larger
  weight could be placed upon it without any injurious effect.</p>

  <p>The timbers supporting the joists for the floor are also placed upon small blocks of concrete,
  about one foot cube, at a distance of eight feet apart. On these are fixed the flooring-joists,
  and a deal floor an inch and a half thick is laid on them, as has been already mentioned, with
  intervals of about half an inch between the boards.</p>

  <p class="sp5">Having thus described in detail all the different portions of the construction of
  the building, we must proceed to give some account of its actual erection, which will enable us to

  alt="F"/>ROM the great extent of the area required for the building, it was not to be expected
  that any site would be found of the necessary size, perfectly level. On the ground occupied by the
  building there is a difference of level between the two extreme ends of about eight feet. In
  consequence of this fall of the natural surface from west to east, and in order to avoid having a
  considerable flight of steps at one end of the building to compensate for it, it was determined to
  arrange the floor with an inclination following nearly that of the ground, such fall being at the
  rate of one inch in twenty-four feet. All the lines of the building which would be called
  horizontal in fact follow this line of the floor, and those which are supposed to be upright are
  placed at right angles to the floor, and therefore slightly inclined from the perpendicular
  towards the east. The deviation, however, is so exceedingly small as to be perfectly imperceptible
  even to those who are aware of the fact; and no one who was not previously informed of it would be
  able to detect it.</p>

  <p>It has been mentioned that Messrs. Fox and Henderson's tender for the building was verbally
  accepted on the 16th of July, 1850, and on the 30th of that month they obtained possession of the
  site from the Commissioners of Woods and Forests.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The first proceeding was to inclose the whole area (including a considerable space
  at each end more than would be covered by the building) with a hoarding about eight feet high, put
  together in a very simple manner, so that the boards were afterwards available for the flooring.
  The supports for the hoarding consisted of pieces of timber fixed in the ground in pairs, at
  intervals of the length of the boards, leaving a narrow space between them, into which the boards
  were dropped, and thus held in their place without any nails. Temporary offices were then erected
  in a convenient portion of the site, and were covered with a roofing which was a specimen of that
  to be used in the building itself. Considerable ranges of carpenters' sheds were also put up, and
  even stables for twenty or thirty horses, which were required in the progress of the works.</p>

  <p><img src="images/initial_t.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="T"/>HE
  first thing to be done towards the building itself was to set out accurately all the points where
  the columns would stand, as well as the general outline of the building. It will be readily
  understood that this was an exceedingly important part of the work, as upon its accuracy depended
  the fitting together of the various parts that had afterwards to be put in place.</p>

  <p>This part of the work was executed with great precision by Mr. W. G. Brounger. He commenced by
  determining the four extreme angles of the building, and the centre lines of the main avenues.
  These formed fixed points from which were determined the whole of the centres for the columns.</p>

  <p>Our readers will recollect that the dimension of twenty-four feet occurs horizontally
  throughout the building, either in multiples or sub-multiples. In order to measure off the
  different distances, rods of American pine were made, into which, near the ends, pieces of metal
  were fixed, having corresponding notches at the exact distance of twenty-four feet apart. By these
  means the lengths were measured off with great accuracy, as the wood used is not liable to
  alteration in the length of its fibre; and by means of the metal notches the rods were sure to be
  placed correctly together. It was necessary to make these sockets or notches of metal, from the
  great amount of work the rods had to perform.</p>

  <p>In determining the length of the rods, the standard of the Astronomical Society was used; and
  this was referred to in all important measurements for the castings and other parts of the
  building, to insure their precise eventual agreement in length. This will hardly be considered to
  have been unnecessary when it is remembered that, from the great length of the building, a very
  minute error in any of the parts would have been so multiplied as sensibly to throw out the
  ends.</p>

  <p>To those who are unacquainted with the fact, it may be well to mention that the standard of
  length referred to is obtained from a pendulum, which oscillates seconds, in the latitude of
  London, in a vacuum, at the level of the sea, at a certain fixed temperature. The length of this
  pendulum is then divided into a certain registered number of feet and inches.</p>

  <p>The rods above described were carried along the centre lines of the columns, and the position
  of each column was marked by a small stake driven into the ground; and in order still more
  accurately to fix the centre, a long nail was driven into the head of the stake. In this manner
  the position of every column throughout the building was determined.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The level at which the floor was to be fixed was the next point <span
  class="pagenum" id="page65">{65}</span>determined by the ordinary method of levelling, and stakes,
  with a <img src="images/cs5.png" style="width:0.9em;" alt="T section"/> piece at the top, called
  boning-sticks, were fixed in different parts of the building; by the aid of which the tops of the
  base-pieces for the columns were all afterwards fixed in one plane of the required slope.</p>

  <div class="ac w20 fcenter sp2">

  next proceeding was to excavate the holes for the concrete, on which the base-pieces were to
  stand. To do this, the stakes marking the centres of the columns had to be removed, and it was
  therefore necessary to adopt some method of finding those centres again with precision. For this
  purpose a large carpenter's square, as it is called, was made. This instrument forms a
  right-angled triangle, and in this instance was used in the following manner:&mdash;The centre of
  its longest side, or hypothenuse, was marked by a line, which, if continued, would pass through
  the right angle of the triangle, and at an equal distance along each of the other sides of the
  triangle from the right angle an upright saw-cut or notch was made. The square was then placed
  horizontally, so that the line marked on the hypothenuse coincided with that of the centres of a
  row of columns, and so that the right-angled corner of the square touched the nail marking the
  exact site of a column. Two small stakes were then driven under the notches in the short arms of
  the square, and nails were driven into them through the notches. It will be seen that by these
  means the site of the first stake could easily be again ascertained after its removal. The holes
  for the concrete were then dug of an oval form and of the various sizes and depths required, and
  the concrete filled in to the proper height. The gravel used for the concrete was raised in a pit
  at one end of the ground.</p>

  <p>Next to the setting out of the positions of the columns, perhaps the operation of fixing the
  base-pieces was that in which the greatest accuracy was required; for as there were in some parts
  three storeys of columns to be fixed over them, any inaccuracy as to their level or position would
  be very much increased at the top of the building. To fix the base-pieces over the centres that
  had been determined for the columns, another carpenter's square was made use of, like that already
  described, but having the right-angled corner cut out to the form of the section of a column. This
  square being placed with the notches in its short sides over the two stakes already described, the
  upright portion of the base-piece was fitted into the notch at the angle; and as the reader will
  at once see, if he has followed us in the description of the various processes, its correct
  position was thus exactly found.</p>

  <p>In order to determine the level of the top of the base-pieces, boning-sticks were placed in the
  lines of the columns, and when the base-piece <span class="pagenum" id="page66">{66}</span>had
  been approximately fixed, a piece of wood was placed on it edgeways, the top of which was to range
  with the top of the boning-sticks. This was easily arranged by looking along them; and the workmen
  drove down the base-piece with a wooden mallet till the desired level was obtained.</p>

  <p>From what has been previously stated, it may be gathered that the base-pieces had to be fixed
  truly upright in one direction, but slightly inclined in the other; and to effect this a
  plumb-rule was made, on which the deviation from the perpendicular line was marked; and this, when
  applied to those faces of the base-pieces which were to incline, served to show when the proper
  inclination was arrived at, whilst an ordinary plumb-rule applied to the other upright faces
  tested their vertical position.</p>

  <p>The first column was raised on the ground on the 26th of September, but little more than two
  months after the tender had been accepted. In the meantime, many of the different castings had
  already arrived on the ground, and a considerable advance had been made in the carpenter's work
  for the gutters and other parts. The semi-circular ribs for the transept roof were also being put
  together, and stacked in such a manner as not to stand in the way of the other works.</p>

  thus be raised from or deposited at any point within a circle of a certain radius, depending on
  the length of the derrick; whereas, in an ordinary crane, the weight can only be placed at points

  alt="M"/>ANY of the persons who visited the building during the progress of its erection were
  heard to inquire "where was the scaffolding;" and others even imagined that the skeleton framework
  they saw was, in fact, only the scaffolding for the building, and not parts of its actual
  construction. This leads us to point out one of the most interesting peculiarities of the
  structure; namely, that it formed, as it were, the scaffolding for its own erection. In order to
  raise the columns upon the base-pieces, two poles were placed upright, connected by a horizontal
  piece, forming what is called shear-legs; the whole being steadied in its position by ropes from
  the summit fixed to the ground in various directions. A rope with pulleys fixed to the horizontal
  piece served to hoist the column, and sustain it in a vertical position until the bolts were
  passed through the projecting rings at the bottom of the column and the corresponding ones at the
  top of the base-piece, and screwed up. When two columns had been thus fixed, a connecting-piece
  was attached to each end of a girder, and the whole raised by the same apparatus, and fixed on the
  top of the columns; bolts being passed through the holes in the projections of the
  connecting-pieces, corresponding with those on the top of the columns. The shear-legs were then
  moved on twenty-four feet to perform the same duties to another pair of columns; and two sides of
  a 24-feet bay were thus formed. To complete the square, two more girders were raised in a similar
  manner, and fixed between the connecting-pieces over the columns. The square bay then became a
  firm structure, requiring no further support; and by repeating these operations all the smaller
  avenues of the building were erected, of the different heights of one, two, or three storeys. The
  greatest number of columns thus fixed in one week was 310.</p>

  wrought-iron roof-trusses over the 48-feet avenues were raised in a similar manner to the columns
  and girders; and in all cases horses were employed to run out the end of the fall-rope, which was
  passed through a pulley or catch-block at the foot of the shear-legs, in order to change its
  direction from vertical to horizontal.</p>

  <p>For raising the roof-trusses of seventy-two feet span over the main avenue a somewhat different
  method was employed. A single mast or derrick, more than seventy feet high, was placed in the
  centre of the avenue, and steadied in an upright position by guide-ropes spreading from the top in
  various directions. Near its summit the hoisting-tackle was firmly lashed on. The trusses to be
  hoisted were brought from the places where they had been put together, and placed across the main
  avenue at the points where they were to be fixed. Two ends of a stout chain were passed round the
  upper portion of the truss, at points dividing its length into about three equal parts. To this
  chain the hoisting-tackle was attached, guide-ropes being further fastened to each end of the
  truss to steady it in its ascent. In order to stiffen the truss horizontally, struts were attached
  at the centre projecting on each side, and held in their place by tie-rods attached to the upper
  part of the truss, and forming a triangle on each side. Before the truss, therefore, could bend in
  a horizontal direction, the attachment of these tie-rods must have given way. Six horses drew out
  the end of the fall-rope, and in the course of a very few minutes the truss was hoisted to its
  giddy height, and each end slipped in between the projections made in the connecting-pieces to
  receive it.</p>

  <p>The animated scene presented by these operations was highly interesting from the number of men
  employed, both on the ground and for fixing the trusses in their position aloft, and from the
  rapid progress so many hands made. Each gang of men was managed by a foreman, who was obliged to
  issue his orders through a speaking-trumpet, to enable his voice to be heard in the din caused by
  the other works going on around. Besides the two large gangs of men engaged in the hoisting of the
  trusses, other smaller gangs were at work at different points getting up the columns and girders.
  In one part, the roofing of which was completed as early as practicable, a crowd of carpenters
  were preparing the Paxton's gutters and other portions of the work. In another place, as soon as a
  sufficient space could be roofed over and a temporary floor laid, various parts of the machinery
  we have already described were fitted up and worked by portable steam-engines. Of these there were
  three in different parts: one drove the machinery for finishing the sash-bars, gutters, ridges,
  &amp;c.; another worked the drilling, punching, and other machinery connected with the iron-work;
  and a third was used for working circular saws.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page70">{70}</span></div>

  <p>Of the number of trusses that were hoisted as above described, in only one instance (and that
  the first) was the result otherwise than perfectly successful. The first truss was raised by its
  ends, instead of from the centre; but that method was afterwards abandoned, from the difficulty of
  maintaining the truss in an upright position during its ascent; which was important, as, if it
  turned on its side, its lateral strength was not sufficient to prevent it from bending, which
  would have destroyed the joints of the work.</p>

  <p>One of the tall masts was worked on each side of the transept, from the centre to the ends of
  the building, being maintained constantly in an upright position, while traversing from point to
  point, by alternate slackening and hauling up of the ropes which steadied it; and it was curious
  to witness the motion of these tall giants, as they slowly progressed from one point to another,
  in the performance of their important office. Stout planks were laid along the ground, upon which
  the foot of the mast was forced forward by crowbars and levers; the planks served also to
  distribute the weight, which would otherwise have sunk the end into the ground. As many as seven
  trusses were hoisted in one day by each derrick, which had therefore to travel a distance of 168
  feet.</p>

  <p>So careful were the men, under the direction of the manager (to whom was intrusted the active
  superintendence of the whole erection of the building), that no accident of importance occurred in
  these difficult operations.</p>

  connexion with the fixing of the girders, it may be desirable to mention the provision that was
  made for the expansion and contraction of the iron, which in so great a length as that of the
  building might have otherwise produced results prejudicial to its stability.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page71">{71}</span></div>

  <p>Between the projections cast on to the connecting-pieces and those projecting from the ends of
  the girders which they were made to clip, sufficient space was left for the introduction of oak
  keys, by driving in which the girder was fixed in its place, whilst the compressibility of the
  wood left sufficient play for the expansion of the metal. In describing the girders, it was
  mentioned that in the upper and lower flat flanges small sinkings were cast near the ends.
  Corresponding with these sinkings, a notch was left in the projection which came out from the
  connecting-piece; and when the girder was put into its place, iron wedges were driven in between
  the notch and the sinking, by which means any lateral motion of the girder was prevented. It was a
  great advantage to have the means of fixing the girders of so simple a nature, as any arrangement
  presenting the least complication, or requiring great nicety, would have materially retarded the
  progress of the work.</p>

  <p>The wrought-iron trusses were held by the connecting-pieces in a similar manner to the
  cast-iron girders; but, as an additional security, bolts were passed through holes provided in the
  standards at the ends, and through the connecting-pieces, where they were screwed up with
  nuts.</p>

  <p>The raising and fixing of the extra-strong roof-trusses crossing the main avenue near the side
  of the transept required particular care, from their great weight; the heaviest being, as we have
  before mentioned, no less than eight tons. These trusses were the first that were fixed across the
  central avenue, and about 150 men were engaged in the hoisting of each one. They are secured to
  the columns by four strong bolts passing through the end-standards.</p>

  <p class="sp5">In order to provide additional support for the great weight brought upon the
  last-mentioned trusses by the transept roof, extra columns were introduced underneath them. These
  were built up in storeys corresponding with those of the other columns, with which they were
  connected, at the levels of the girders, by bolts and straps. A cast-iron shoe, fixed on the top
  of the columns, provided a bearing for the ends of the truss. The columns just described project
  slightly into the main avenue from the line of the other columns; and this is the only instance in
  the interior of the building of the iron columns occurring at a less distance than twenty-four
  feet apart.</p>

  <p><img src="images/initial_w.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="W"/>E
  have now traced the erection of the building up to the level of the roof, in which it will be
  readily conceived the operation of glazing was one of extreme difficulty, there being no
  scaffolding to aid the workmen in conducting their operations. When the glazing was first
  commenced a light scaffolding was suspended from the rafters; but <span class="pagenum"
  id="page72">{72}</span>this was found to be too tedious and troublesome a method of proceeding for
  so large an extent of roofing. It was, moreover, of great importance that some means should be
  devised for completing this part of the construction independently of the weather; a matter of
  some moment, when it is remembered that the work had to be done in the winter, when in our climate
  such operations are liable to be very much impeded by heavy rain. The arrangements made to meet
  this difficulty, as well as some others for carrying on the works, are very clearly described in a
  paper by Mr. Digby Wyatt, read at the Institution of Civil Engineers, on the 14th January, 1851,
  from which we quote some passages, by permission, for the benefit of our readers.</p>

  <p>With reference to the means employed for glazing the roof he says: "To effect this purpose, a
  travelling stage was devised by Mr. Fox, which superseded the necessity of any scaffolding for
  glazing, and by means of seventy-six of these machines nearly the whole of the work has been
  executed. The stage was about eight feet square, and rested on four small wheels travelling in the
  Paxton's gutters. It thus embraced a width of one bay of eight feet of the roof, with one ridge
  and two sloping sides. Each bay in width required, therefore, a separate stage."</p>

  <p>"Each stage was occupied by two workmen, and was covered by an awning of canvass stretched over
  hoops, to protect them in bad weather, and was further provided with a box on each side to contain
  a supply of glass. The sash-bars and other materials were piled upon the stage itself, the centre
  of the platform being left open for the convenience of hoisting up materials, for which purpose
  there was a small iron arm with a single block pulley."</p>

    <div class="smaller ac">
      <p class="sp0">GLAZING-WAGGON, FOR FLAT ROOF.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Whilst working, the men sat at one end of the platform (the ridge having been previously fixed
  in position by means of the extra-strong sash-bars), and they fixed the glass in front of them,
  pushing the stage backwards as they completed each pane. On coming to the strong sash-bars
  previously fixed, they temporarily removed them to allow the stage to pass. In this manner each
  stage travelled, uninterruptedly, from the transept to the east and west ends of the building, and
  the glaziers were enabled to follow up the previously-fixed work very closely. The average amount
  of glazing done by one man per day was fifty-eight squares, or about 200 superficial feet; and the
  largest amount done by any one man in a working-day was 108 squares, or 367 superficial feet."</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page73">{73}</span></div>

  <p class="sp5">The mode of fixing the squares of glass was this: a sash-bar having been nailed
  down between the ridge and the gutter, the workman inserted one long edge of a square of glass
  into the groove in the sash-bar, he then placed a loose bar against the other long edge of the
  glass and brought the whole down to bear upon the ridge and gutter, the second sash-bar fitting
  into the notches prepared for it; the glass was then pressed up a little, in order to insert its
  upper edge into the groove in the ridge, and the workman then filled in the grooves on the outside
  of the glass with putty, the lower edge of the glass having been also bedded on putty where it
  bears on the edge of the gutter. The ends of each sash-bar were fixed with a nail driven into the
  holes previously drilled.</p>

  <p class="sp5"><img src="images/initial_a.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;"
  alt="A"/>S it might naturally be expected that out of the thousands of panes of glass employed,
  particularly in the flat roof of the building, many would be broken in the course of the works,
  subsequently to their being fixed, it was necessary that a ready means should be devised for
  repairing any such damage, as the glazing-waggons used for the first execution of the work would
  not be available for that purpose. A light stage was therefore constructed, travelling with wooden
  wheels upon the ridges instead of in the gutters; and from this the men were able to perform their
  work without walking along the narrow gutters, which would have been attended with much risk. This
  stage was also used for fixing the canvass on the outside of the roofing, where it is nailed along
  the ridges, and allowed to bag down slightly between them. The object of the canvass, which covers
  externally the whole of the roof except the transept, is twofold: it preserves the glass from
  damage, and also protects the objects exhibited from the direct rays of the sun, which would, of
  course, in many instances, be very prejudicial; for the latter purpose the upright sashes on the
  south side are also covered with canvass on the inside.</p>

  of the most interesting operations which attracted the attention of the numerous visitors to the
  works was the raising the ribs for the semicircular roof of the transept, the description of which
  we give from Mr. Wyatt's paper<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"The operation about which most anxiety had been felt was the hoisting <span class="pagenum"
  id="page74">{74}</span>of the arched ribs of the transept. These ribs were constructed on the
  ground horizontally, and when completed with all their bolts, two of them were reared on end, and
  maintained in a vertical position, at a distance of twenty-four feet from each other, by
  guy-ropes. As the ribs singly possessed little lateral stiffness, they were framed together in
  pairs with the purlins, intermediate small ribs and diagonal tie-rods, forming a complete bay of
  the roof twenty-four feet long; two complete sets of temporary ties were also introduced to
  provide for the strains incident to the variations in position of the ribs during the hoisting.
  The feet of the ribs were bolted on to a stout piece of timber, and the lower purlins strutted up
  from the same." In this state the framework is shown in the engraving.</p>

      <p class="sp0">A PAIR OF RIBS PREPARED FOR RAISING.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"The whole framework was then moved on rollers to the centre of the square formed by the
  intersection of the transept and the main avenue, where it was afterwards hoisted. All the ribs
  were landed over this square, and were afterwards moved on a tramway formed of a half baulk of
  timber constructed over the columns on either side of the transept, at a height of about four feet
  above the lead-flat. The hoisting-tackle consisted of four crabs, each one being placed on the
  side of the transept opposite to the part of the ribs to be lifted by it, so that the men at the
  crabs might watch the effect of their exertions with greater convenience."</p>

  <p class="sp3">"The hoisting-shears were placed on the lead-flat immediately over the deep trusses
  of seventy-two feet span; each set consisted of three stout scaffold-poles, lashed together at the
  top, and footed on planks laid across the flat, and secured by the necessary guy-ropes. The
  hoisting-rope passed from each of the crabs across the transept horizontally, to a leading block
  attached to the foot of the opposite angle column of the square; it then passed up to a treble
  block fastened to the shears on the flat, and from thence down to a double block secured by chains
  to the bottom part of the ribs."</p>

  <p>"There was a peculiar difficulty to be overcome in this operation, which arose from the
  circumstance that the width of the framework was greater than that of the transept, the extreme
  width of the framework to be hoisted being seventy-four feet, and the clear width apart of the
  trusses above which it had to be hoisted being only seventy-one feet four inches. It was therefore
  necessary to raise one side to a height of thirty-five feet before raising the other, so as to
  diminish the horizontal width of the whole, the diameter of the semicircle being maintained at
  this angle; the whole was then hoisted, until the highest end could clear the tramway."</p>

  <p>This accounts for the slanting position in which the ribs are shown in the view given.</p>

  <p>"The foot of the ribs on one side was then passed over the tramway sufficiently to allow the
  other side to clear the opposite truss; after which the whole was hoisted to the full height, and
  rested on rollers of hard wood placed between the sills attached to the framework and the tramway,
  by means of which it was moved to its permanent position. There it was again raised by another set
  of shears, while the sill and tramway were removed from under it; and the ribs were then lowered
  into the sockets prepared for them, formed by the continuation of the columns above the level of
  the lead-flat."</p>

  <p>"Each successive pair of ribs was fixed at a distance of twenty-four feet, or one bay from the
  preceding one; and the purlins, &amp;c., were fixed in the intervening space without any
  scaffolding from the ground, by means of jointed ladders, which were adjusted to the form of the
  roof."</p>

  <p class="sp5">The first pair of ribs was hoisted December 4th, and the eighth pair on December
  12th. The operation, which was one of great excitement and considerable anxiety, was personally
  superintended by the contractors, aided by their most able foremen and assistants; and a crowd of
  visitors, including many of the illustrious promoters of the undertaking, watched with intense
  interest the steady ascent of the apparently unwieldy piece of construction, and every spectator
  seemed astonished at the mechanical regularity with which the whole operation proceeded. It took
  about one hour to raise a pair from the ground to the level of the lead-flat, and the whole was
  done without any accident whatever. About sixty men were employed in the hoisting, there being
  eleven men to each crab, and the remainder on the lead-flats.</p>

  semicircular form of the transept roof rendered it necessary to adopt a different mode of
  operation for glazing it to that used in the horizontal portion. A stage, thirty-two feet long and
  about three feet wide, with a protecting rail at the side, was constructed, so that it rested upon
  rollers, travelling on the ridges. It was slung by ropes from the crown of the arched roof, and
  could be raised and lowered at pleasure. It accommodated eight workmen, with the necessary
  quantity of materials in sash-bars and glass; and they thus performed, with ease and rapidity, an
  operation which before the fitting-up of the stage appeared at least extremely difficult, and to
  the uninitiated next to impossible.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The men commenced fixing the glass at the bottom or springing of the arch, and as
  they completed their work the stage was raised at intervals by labourers stationed on the
  lead-flat. A portion of the glazing at the crown of the arch was effected by men working on a
  light scaffold, suspended within from the temporary ties mentioned as having been attached to the
  ribs; whilst those upon the stage worked upwards till they joined the portion done from the
  top.</p>

  PORTION of the work which necessarily occupied a very large amount of time was the painting, which
  was necessary for the preservation of all the parts, as well as for their appearance; and when it
  is considered that every portion required to be gone over four times, it must be evident that it
  was highly desirable to adopt some means <span class="pagenum" id="page77">{77}</span>for
  facilitating the operation. It was found that the sash-bars of the roof, being in short lengths
  and of small dimensions, could readily be operated upon by some mechanical contrivance.</p>

  <p>A wooden trough was made sufficiently long to receive the sash-bars, and this was filled with
  paint; a number of the bars were then put into it, and upon being taken out separately, they were
  passed through a frame into which a set of brushes were fixed in such a manner as to clear off all
  the unnecessary paint. Two small brushes, placed where the bar first entered the frame, cleared
  out the grooves. One workman pushed the bar in at one end of the frame, which was about two feet
  six inches long, and another drew it out at the other end, where a trough was placed to receive
  any droppings of paint. The bars were then stacked upright, until they were sufficiently dry for
  the next coat. The first coat only was put on by this apparatus, the second being done in the
  ordinary manner, and the last not till after the work was all fixed in its place. By means of this
  apparatus a workman could perform at least ten times the amount of work done in the ordinary
  way.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The finishing the painting of the various parts of the roof internally, after they
  had been put together, was very ingeniously managed, so that while the workmen were able to work
  with ease to themselves, the scaffolding on which they stood required no supports from the ground,
  where they would have been much in the way of other operations; loops of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page78">{78}</span>wrought-iron were hooked on to the roof-trusses, and by means of these a
  perfect cloud of scaffold-boards was suspended, enabling between 400 and 500 men to be at work at
  one time. The roof of the main avenue, particularly, presented a very singular appearance, as
  nearly one half of the entire length was thus covered at one time, and a crowd of painters were at
  work over the heads of many, perhaps unconscious exhibitors, who were arranging their goods
  undisturbed below.</p>

  of the mechanical contrivances which were put up on the ground during the works, for saving labour
  and increasing the rapidity of production, remains to be mentioned; it was contrived for turning
  out the rounded mahogany hand-rail for the gallery railing as well as that for the staircases.</p>

  <p>The mahogany being supplied in slabs of the requisite thickness, these were first cut up by
  circular saws into pieces of a square section, and the angles of these were then bevelled off by
  the same means; the lengths were afterwards transferred to the hand-rail cutting machine to be

  which a strap may be passed to drive it. At one end of this cylinder four cutters are fixed, so
  that a piece of wood passing between them and through the cylinder, as it revolves, is rounded off
  to a true circular form of section, and is turned out so smoothly <span class="pagenum"

  cutters, which form, as it were, the jaws of the hollow cylinder, which thus seems to be
  constantly swallowing lengths of rough mahogany, which escape from it finished. The wooden rail is
  passed up to the cutters along a groove, the end of which is shown in the small engraving; and
  opposite each end of the revolving cylinder springs are fixed, which prevent the rail from
  shifting its position. The hand-rail was all turned out in 21-feet lengths, of which about thirty
  were completed in the day.</p>

  have mentioned that the actual commencement of the building was made by fixing one of the columns
  on the 26th of September; and, within a few weeks, more than a thousand men were at work, though,
  from the great extent of the ground they were spread over, it was difficult to estimate their
  number, which was, however, made apparent by the rapidity with which the building began to grow.
  The place presented an animated and interesting scene, which attracted a great number of visitors;
  and crowds of the fair sex were not deterred by the rough state of the ground from endeavouring to
  satisfy their proverbial thirst for knowledge. In one part of the ground might be seen the putting
  together of the wrought-iron roof-girders to the deafening tune of more than a hundred hammers; in
  another place gutters were being put together by the mile, for which some hundred or two of
  sawyers were cutting up ship-loads of timber. Three portable steam-engines in various parts were
  driving the different machinery already described, which, however, was mostly grouped in one place
  near the transept. The central avenue formed, of course, the great thoroughfare, where teams of
  horses were constantly passing, dragging the slender columns, or unwieldy-looking girders, to
  their places, while other teams were engaged in running them up to their final position.
  Over-head, too, the glaziers' waggons, dotted about the roof, seemed to be running on some new
  aerial railways; in every direction that the eye turned the busy scene extended.</p>

  <p>For carrying on these extensive works an immense number of men were necessarily employed on the
  spot, besides those occupied in preparing the various parts at different places. The greatest
  number of men on the ground in any one week was 2,260; and the season of the year frequently
  rendered it necessary for the workmen to continue their labours after dark, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page80">{80}</span>which they did partly by the light of huge bonfires of shavings and odd
  scraps of wood. The effect of these great fires, which were generally lighted in some part of the
  main avenue, was exceedingly grand. The light of the tall flames was reflected from the glass of
  the roof far away into the darkness which concealed all the other parts; whilst occasionally a
  lantern carried by a workman engaged in fixing the upper columns, or some part of the roof,
  glimmered like some new star.</p>

  <p class="sp5">On one occasion, when the greatest efforts were being made to push on the progress
  of the works, no less than twelve large bonfires lighted the men at their midnight toil; and had
  the building been formed of combustible materials, a passing observer would have imagined that the
  whole was in flames.</p>

  process of distributing their wages among so large a number of men, on every recurring Saturday
  evening, was one which could only be effected within a reasonable time by some systematic
  arrangement; and to such perfection was this brought in the course of the works, that the whole
  number of 2,000 men or upwards were sometimes paid in little more than an hour; though at first it
  occupied a considerably longer time.</p>

  <p>The mode in which this was effected was as follows:&mdash;When a workman was engaged his name
  was entered in a book against a certain number, which was stamped on several brass tickets, three
  of which were given to each workman before leaving the ground in the evening.</p>

  <p>Every man had to enter the premises three times in the course of the day; namely, the first
  thing in the morning, after returning from breakfast, and after returning from dinner. On each
  occasion he was required to deposit at the gate one of these tickets, which were afterwards sorted
  by the clerks, and entered in the time-book. In this way, if a man failed to come to his work, his
  ticket would be missing, and the time during which he was absent would not be entered; a
  corresponding amount being deducted from his week's wages.</p>

  <p>On the Saturday, each man's time was made up from the book; and his <span class="pagenum"
  id="page81">{81}</span>wages calculated accordingly, and the amount entered against his name. The
  money due to each man was then counted out and placed in a small tin box, with a ticket, on which
  was written the man's name and number, and the amount of wages paid to him.</p>

  <p>All this was done in the time-keeper's office, which was conveniently placed near the entrance
  to the works. When all the preliminary arrangements had been completed, the workmen's bell was
  rung, and they assembled (a motley and sometimes clamorous crowd) round the pay-office, which was
  provided with two small openings through which the payments were made.</p>

  themselves, in the order in which they were called, at the pay-windows, where each man took the
  small box passed out to him with the money, and left the box in passing out at the gate. If any
  man considered the amount of wages paid to him not correct, he presented the ticket given to him
  with the wages at the office on the Monday morning following, when the matter was arranged by the

  is with great pleasure that we are able to mention that, notwithstanding the difficult character
  of some of the work, and the extreme rapidity with which it was carried on, very few accidents of
  importance occurred; a circumstance which must be ascribed to the great care taken by the
  contractors for the safety of the men while engaged in their work: and in the cases where the
  accidents that occurred were of a serious or fatal kind, their origin was mostly to be traced to a
  neglect of those precautions which the men were constantly urged and ordered to take.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page83">{83}</span></div>

  <p>A few statistics of the quantities of different parts of the work not already mentioned will
  complete this portion of our subject. The whole amount of iron-work in the building is stated at
  about 4000 tons; and about 1,200 loads of timber were required for the wood-work. There are 2,941
  trussed gutters in the roof, and 1,495 glazed sashes were required to inclose the sides of the
  building. As many as 316 iron girders were cast, in one week, and 442 lengths of the Paxton's
  gutters were cut out by the machinery in the same time. No less than 18,392 squares of glass,
  containing 62,508 feet superficial, or about one-and-a-half acres, were also fixed in one
  week.</p>

  <p>It may be further mentioned that the weight of the different parts forming the flat
  ridge-and-furrow roofing amounts to three-and-a-quarter pounds per foot superficial, on the whole
  surface; the weight of the arched roof of the transept, including the ribs, amounts to
  five-and-three-quarter pounds per superficial foot; and the timbers and boards of the gallery
  floor weigh eight-and-a-half pounds to the superficial foot: from these data the actual weight on
  the different girders may be calculated.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The light iron-work, with the exception of some of the gallery railing, was cast at
  the works of the contractors near Birmingham; and the remainder, including the columns, girders,
  &amp;c., was distributed between their own foundry, and those of the Messrs. Cochrane, of Wood
  Side, and Mr. Jobson, of Holly Hall, both near Dudley. The wrought-iron was supplied by Messrs.
  Fothergill, and the timber by Messrs. Dowson and Co.</p>

  coloured decoration introduced in finishing the painting of the building is a subject which has
  been much discussed, and many suggestions have been made by persons generally received as
  authorities on the subject. The system adopted was proposed by Mr. Owen Jones, under whose active
  superintendence it has been carried out. That gentleman explained his reasons for its adoption,
  and the effect which he expected it to produce, in a lecture at the Institute of British
  Architects, on the 16th of December, 1850, some portions of which are submitted to our
  readers<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>"It is not necessary for me to describe the building, the painting of which we are now about to
  discuss, as it is well known to most of you by its marvellous dimensions, the simplicity of its
  construction, and the advantage which has been taken of the power which the repetition of simple
  forms will give in producing grandeur of effect; and I wish now to show that this grandeur may be
  still further enhanced by a system of colouring which, by marking distinctly every line in the
  building, will increase the height, the length, and the bulk.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page84">{84}</span></div>

  <p>"The very nature of the material of which this building is mainly constructed, viz., iron,
  requires that it should be painted. On what principle shall we do this? Should we be justified in
  adopting a simple tint of white or stone colour, the usual method of painting iron? Now, it must
  be borne in mind that this building will be covered on the south side, and over the whole of the
  roof, with canvass, so that there can be but little light and shade. The myriads of similar lines,
  therefore, of which the building is composed, falling one before the other, would lose all
  distinctness, and form, in fact, one dull cloud overhanging the Exhibition.</p>

  <p>"A line of columns (as it may be seen even now at the building) would present the effect of a
  white wall, and it would be impossible, in the distance, to distinguish one column from another.
  This mode of painting would have the further disadvantage of rendering the building totally
  unconnected with the various objects it is to contain.</p>

  <p>"May the building be painted of a dark colour, like the roofs of some of our railway-stations?
  This, equally with the white method, would present one mass of indistinctness; the relief of the
  cast-iron would disappear, and each column and girder would present to the eye but a flat
  silhouette.</p>

  <p>"Let us now consider the building as painted with some pale neutral tint, dull green or buff.
  In doing this we should be perfectly safe, as, provided the colours were not too pale so as to be
  indistinct, or too dark so as sensibly to affect the eye, we could hardly make a mistake. Yet how
  tame and monotonous would be the result! It would be necessary that this tint, whichever we might
  choose, should be of a very subdued neutral character, in order to avoid the difficulty well known
  to mounters of drawings and painters of picture-galleries, viz., that in proportion as you incline
  to any particular shade of colour, so in that exact proportion you injure or destroy those objects
  it is intended to relieve which may have similar colour. To this, then, we should be
  reduced&mdash;a dull monotonous colour without character. How unworthy this would be of the great
  occasion!  How little would it impress the public! How little would it teach the artist! It would
  be to cut instead of patiently to unravel the knot.</p>

  <p>"We are now brought to the consideration of the only other well-defined system which presents
  itself, namely, parti-colouring. This, I conceive, if successfully worked out, would bring the
  building and its contents into perfect harmony, and it would fitly carry out one of the objects
  for which this Exhibition was formed, namely, that of promoting the union of the fine-arts with
  manufactures. It would be an experiment on an immense scale, which, if successful, would tend to
  dispel the prejudices of those whose eyes are yet unformed to colour, to develope the imperfect
  appreciations of others, and to save this country from the reproach which foreign visitors, more
  educated in this particular than ourselves, would not fail to make were the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page85">{85}</span>building otherwise painted; it would everywhere bring out the construction
  of the building, which, as I said before, would also appear higher, longer, and more solid."</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones then adduced the practice of the ancient and mediæval artists, and explained the kind
  of colours they generally adopted, mentioning that in the best periods of art the primary colours
  were chiefly or exclusively used.</p>

  <p>"In the decoration of the Exhibition building I therefore propose to use the colours blue, red,
  and yellow, in such relative quantities as to neutralise or destroy each other; thus no one colour
  will be dominant or fatiguing to the eye, and all the objects exhibited will assist, and be
  assisted by, the colours of the building itself.</p>

  <p>"In house-decoration we occasionally find a run on one colour; thus we have a green room, a
  pink room, and a red room; but it would obviously be unwise to adopt any one colour for this
  building, whose contents will be of all imaginable hues from white to black. Discarding, on the
  other hand, the perfect neutral white as unfit for the occasion, we naturally adopt the colours
  blue, red, and yellow, in or near the neutral proportions of eight, five, and three; but to avoid
  any harsh antagonism of the primary colours when in contact, or any undesired complementary
  secondaries arising from the immediate proximity of the primaries, I propose, in all cases, to
  interpose a line of white between them, which will soften them and give them their true value.</p>

  <p>"As one of the objects of decorating a building is to increase the effect of light and shade,
  the best means of using blue, red, and yellow is to place blue, which retires, on the concave
  surfaces; yellow, which advances, on the convex; and red, the colour of the middle distance, on
  the horizontal planes; and the neutral white on the vertical planes.</p>

  <p>"Following out this principle on the building in question, we have red for the under-side of
  the girders, yellow on the round portions of the columns, and blue in the hollow parts of the
  capitals.</p>

  <p>"Now, it is necessary not only to put the several colours in the right places, but also to use
  them in their due proportions to each other.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Field, in his admirable works on colour, has shown by direct experiment that white light
  consists of blue, red, and yellow, neutralising each other in the proportions of eight, five, and
  three. It will readily be seen, that the nearer we can arrive at this state of neutrality the more
  harmonious and light-giving will a building become; and an examination of the most perfect
  specimens of harmonious colouring of the ancients will show that this proportion has generally
  obtained among them; that is to say, broadly, there has been as much blue as the yellow and red
  put together, the light and the shade balancing each other.</p>

  <p>"Of course, we cannot in decorating buildings always command the exact proportions of coloured
  surface which we require; but the balance of <span class="pagenum" id="page86">{86}</span>colours
  can always be obtained by a change in the colours themselves. Thus, if the surfaces to be coloured
  should give too much yellow, we should make the red more crimson and the blue more purple; that
  is, we should take the yellow out of them. So, if we had too much blue, we should make the yellow
  more orange, and the red more scarlet.</p>

  <p>"A practised eye will as readily do this as a musician can tune a musical instrument; it is
  here that science abandons the artist, who must trust to his own perceptions, cultivated by
  renewed trials and repeated failures."</p>

  <p>In concluding, Mr. Jones said, with reference to some specimens of the proposed decoration
  which had been executed, "I would ask you to banish from your minds the glare of light by which
  this decoration is now seen&mdash;to forget the rough foreground, where men are engaged in every
  variety of occupation for the completion of this great building; and I would ask you to fill it in
  imagination with the gorgeous products of every clime. I would ask you to picture to yourselves in
  the foreground the brilliant primaries, blue, red, and yellow&mdash;the rich secondaries, purple,
  amber, and green, moulded in forms of every conceivable diversity; and, lastly, against them the
  darker tertiaries fading into neutral perspective.</p>

  <p>"The conception of such an effect, difficult even to the artist accustomed to abstract his
  attention from present interruptions and to calculate future harmonies, is impossible to the
  uninstructed spectator, who, from the experimental decoration of a single column, draws a
  premature and, necessarily, a fallacious inference as to the collective effect of the whole.</p>

  <p>"From my brother architects I hope for a more patient, a more comprehensive, and a fairer
  appreciation; for myself, I have a confident hope, grounded on the experience of years devoted to
  this particular branch of art, that the principles and plans I have had the honour to propose to
  the Royal Commission, for the decoration of this magnificent structure, will be found, when
  complete, not to disappoint the public expectations, or to prove wholly unworthy of the great
  occasion."</p>

  <p class="sp3">In this lecture, Mr. Owen Jones asked his hearers, and the public generally, to
  suspend their final judgment upon his system of colouring until the whole should be completed, and
  the building filled with the objects to be exhibited, as he considered that many of the objections
  which were raised to his proposition resulted from a want of consideration of the ultimate effect
  to be produced by the whole, when completed and occupied; and so far as this effect has been
  realised, we believe it has inclined the public opinion more in favour of the coloured decoration
  than originally, when it was undoubtedly very strongly commented upon in various quarters. Without
  venturing to express any opinion ourselves, we may trust that Mr. Owen Jones's fondest hopes will
  be fully realised.</p>

  subject of the strength and stability of the building is one on which considerable anxiety has
  been felt, both by the public at large and by those professional bodies more capable of forming a
  correct judgment upon it. In the prolonged discussion which followed the reading of Mr. Wyatt's
  paper at the Institution of Civil Engineers, many points of objection were raised which seemed at
  first sight of a very serious nature; but, in most cases, the answers that were given to them were
  perfectly satisfactory. The two greatest difficulties raised were, firstly, the enormous surface
  presented by the exterior to the pressure of the wind, with apparently but a slight power of
  resistance; and, secondly, the construction of the galleries, which, it was thought, would not be
  able to resist the vibratory motion likely to be produced by great numbers of people walking upon
  them. The results of several calculations were adduced on the occasion alluded to in support of
  the objections on the first point; but perhaps the best answer that could be given to them was the
  circumstance mentioned by Mr. Fox&mdash;that on the 5th of that month (January) the pressure of
  the wind, which blew a perfect gale, was not only much above the average, but very nearly reached
  the greatest amount known within a considerable period in London&mdash;about 25lbs. per square
  foot; and that as the building, although in an incomplete state, had resisted that pressure
  without receiving any injury, it was fair to conclude that, when finished, it would <span
  class="pagenum" id="page88">{88}</span>be able to sustain the greatest force which the wind could
  be reasonably expected to exert upon it.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The question of the strength of the galleries was one of even greater importance
  than the other, as, in case of any failure in that part of the building, human life must almost
  inevitably have been sacrificed to a great extent. It was therefore deemed necessary to ascertain,
  as far as was practicable, by experiment, that their strength was abundantly sufficient; and in
  Mr. Wyatt's paper, as printed, the following description of the experiments instituted for this
  purpose will be found.</p>

  </div>

  <p><img src="images/initial_i.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="I"/>N
  the interval between the reading of this paper and its going to press a series of experiments have
  been tried to ascertain the action of these galleries under the strain of a moving load. A
  complete bay, twenty-four feet square, was constructed, raised slightly from the ground,
  consisting of the four cast-iron girders, with the connecting-pieces at the angles, and on this
  the timbers and boards of the flooring. Rows of planks the full width of the platform led up to it
  and down from it, so that a body of men as wide as the gallery might be able to march up and down
  in close rank.</p>

  <p>"The area of the platform was first covered over with labourers packed as closely together as
  possible; but no action of walking, running, or jumping that 300 men could perform did any injury
  whatever to it, and the greatest deflection of the girders did not exceed a quarter of an inch.
  Soldiers of the corps of Royal Sappers and Miners were then substituted for the contractors' men;
  and although the perfect regularity of their step in marking time sharply appeared a remarkably
  severe test, a minute examination of the construction after the completion of the experiments
  showed that no damage whatever had been done by their evolutions.</p>

  <p class="sp4">"But as the Commissioners were deeply impressed with the necessity of thoroughly
  convincing the public, who should visit the Exhibition, that they might feel perfectly secure in
  every part of the building, it was deemed desirable to apply a still further test to the actual
  galleries as they stand; as it might perhaps be said that the single bay which had been
  experimented upon was not similarly circumstanced to those forming parts of the building.</p>

  <p>"For this purpose a very ingenious apparatus was devised by the late Mr. Field, President of
  the Institution of Civil Engineers, for testing the stability of the galleries <i>in situ</i>, and
  on being applied over the greater part of the building not a single bolt or girder gave way under
  its action. This apparatus consisted of eight square wooden frames divided into thirty-six
  compartments, each just capable of containing and allowing to rotate a 68-pounder shot. The
  surfaces of the balls placed in each of these compartments came in contact with the gallery floor,
  the frames themselves being attached to one another and running along the floor by means of
  castors fixed at the angles; the whole apparatus being drawn along by a number of men. Two hundred
  and eighty-eight 68-pound shot confined in a limited area were thus set rolling over more than
  half the extent of the galleries; when, not the slightest mishap having occurred, the experiment
  was considered decisive, and a persistence in it deemed unnecessary."</p>

  <p>The pressure obtained in this experiment amounted to about a hundred pounds per square foot,
  and it had been ascertained that the greatest pressure caused by packing men together as closely
  as possible was equal to about ninety-five pounds per square foot; so that the testing force
  applied was considered amply sufficient, as a considerable portion of the surface of the gallery
  will be occupied by light articles exhibited in the cases and stalls which are placed along the
  centre of the gallery, where a great weight would have most effect.</p>

  <p class="sp5">This ingenious method of proving the strength of the galleries <i>in situ</i>,
  without endangering those engaged in the experiment, is admirable; and the result of the proof
  will no doubt allay all fear in the mind of the public as to the safety of this portion of the
  building.</p>

  <p><img src="images/initial_i.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;" alt="I"/>T
  is always much easier to point out the defects of any work than its excellences; whilst we may,
  therefore, safely leave the former, as regards our present subject, to be discovered and enlarged
  upon by those who may be perhaps more competent than ourselves, we will attempt to point out what
  we conceive to be some of the advantages obtained in the present building.</p>

  <p>One of the principal of these, considering throughout the purpose of the structure, is,
  perhaps, the uninterrupted view of the interior which the spectator may obtain from any point of
  the building&mdash;a matter of great importance to the general grandeur of its effect. From the
  galleries more particularly, which will be less obstructed by large objects, the eye of the
  spectator will be able to range from end to end of the vast edifice; while the transparency of the
  material used for the roof allows every object to be brilliantly illuminated. The slender lines of
  the supports, though they serve to sustain a protecting covering, scarcely interrupt the view of
  the objects protected, and the absence of any fixed divisions or partitions enables all the
  articles exhibited to be so arranged as to suit the peculiar requirements of each particular
  class; while the ample space between the <span class="pagenum" id="page90">{90}</span>supports has
  admitted of the formation of large open avenues for the free passage of visitors, who may thus
  reach as readily the remotest corners of the building as those situated near the entrances; and
  whenever the visitor may find himself fatigued by the labour of sight-seeing, he will be sure to
  find himself near one of the numerous exit-doors, whereby he may immediately free himself from the
  crowd of spectators.</p>

  <p>From the simplicity of the details of the construction, and their constant recurrence, it will
  be seen that so long as the ends of the building were left incomplete, its size could easily be
  limited or expanded, so as to include that precise amount of space which, up to the last moment
  when the point could be kept open, appeared most likely to be required. This simplicity of
  arrangement will also be found very advantageous in case the building is removed after the
  termination of its present temporary purpose; as the parts may be easily separated without much
  injury, and as readily re-erected, either as a whole, or even in many separate buildings, having
  the same arrangement of parts, without the same general form or appearance.</p>

  <p>It has been calculated that the passages remaining in the building, after deducting the space
  appropriated to the objects exhibited, will hold more than 100,000 persons; though it is not to be
  expected that half that number will be collected there at one time. The ventilation and supply of
  fresh air for so vast a throng was therefore a matter of the first importance; and the means
  already described for accomplishing this great object are so ample, that any inconvenience from
  oppressive heat or foul air can hardly be expected. The canvass with which the roof is covered
  will not only serve to modify the heat of the sun in the interior, but it is expected that if it
  be watered by the hose of engines, it may even reduce the temperature within to considerably below
  that of the external air. From his experience in glass-houses for horticultural purposes, Mr.
  Paxton speaks confidently on this point.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The arrangement of the construction of the building resting on isolated instead of
  continuous supports, will enable all traces of it to be readily effaced from the site if it is
  removed; and, on the other hand, if it remains, it is evidently peculiarly suited to form a vast
  winter-garden and public promenade.</p>

  <p><img src="images/initial_b.png" style="float:left; height:5em; margin-right:0.5ex;"
  alt="B"/>EFORE taking leave of the reader who may have patiently followed us thus far, a few words
  may be necessary on the general arrangement of the articles to be exhibited in the building whose
  outline and details we have been endeavouring to trace. The first classification is geographical.
  All the western half of the building is given to England, and the eastern, which is rather the
  larger of the two, to foreign countries; <span class="pagenum" id="page91">{91}</span>the space
  assigned to each country being distinctly defined, so as to avoid the possibility of any disputes.
  As far as it was possible, the space for each country is so arranged as to have a frontage towards
  the main central avenue, and in most cases occupies a strip the whole width of the building; the
  visitor, therefore, passing up and down the length, will not miss out any country.</p>

  <p>In the central avenue, and immediately on either side of it, are placed the most remarkable
  specimens of objects coming under the class of fine-arts, or otherwise sufficiently remarkable to
  entitle them to such a prominent place. Behind these, in the side avenues, will be found the
  various specimens of manufactured articles; and along the outside longitudinal avenues are placed,
  on the south side, those belonging to the class of raw products (a portion being devoted to
  agricultural implements), and the projecting portion of the building on the north side forms the
  hall of machinery, which is separated by a partition of glazed sashes from the rest of the
  building. Many of the articles will be grouped in courts, an arrangement which the construction
  particularly leads to; and these will probably form some of the greatest attractions in the
  Exhibition, each being, as it were, complete in itself, and the inclosures preventing the eye from
  being distracted by distant objects. To enter further into the detail of this part of the subject
  would be foreign to the purpose of this work, the building itself being our text.</p>

  <p>We have now, we believe, completed the pleasant task we proposed to ourselves at the outset,
  and we hope that in doing so we may have been able to render interesting to our general readers
  this description of operations, usually occupying the attention of the technical professions only.
  With this intention, we have avoided as far as possible the use of technical terms, which would be
  a dead letter to the uninitiated, at the risk, perhaps, of being considered inaccurate by those
  acquainted with all the details of the subject.</p>

  <p>So many men whose eminent talent is well known and appreciated by the public have been engaged
  in perfecting the designs and carrying out the erection of this vast structure, that the critic
  should be one of no mean reputation who would venture to raise even a small voice of individual
  criticism on its merits. We have considered it, therefore, to be our part rather to record the
  opinions of others on any points where a discussion has been raised than to trouble the reader
  with any personal views, which would, perhaps, have only appeared impertinent.</p>

  <p>The nature and extent of the difficulties which have been successfully surmounted in carrying
  out this great work can only be fully appreciated by those intimately acquainted with all its
  structural details and with its rapid progress; and its completion in so short a period must be
  regarded as a striking instance of the productive power and spirit of commercial <span
  class="pagenum" id="page92">{92}</span>enterprise of this country, while the fact of its being
  defrayed by the voluntary contributions of the people will illustrate in an interesting manner to
  our continental visitors that principle of self-government which forms the basis of all our
  institutions, and the spirit of private enterprise which characterises most of our great
  undertakings.</p>

  <p>The illustrative engravings with which we have endeavoured to render more interesting the
  descriptive details, necessarily somewhat dry to the general reader, are only intended to convey
  general ideas, without attempting that minute accuracy which would be required in a more technical
  work; and with reference to some of them we take this opportunity of acknowledging the assistance
  our artists have derived from views already published elsewhere, others having been exclusively
  drawn for the present work.</p>

  <p>We have much pleasure in presenting our readers, in the Appendix, with views and descriptions
  of two of the most striking designs sent in the first competition for the building, the materials
  for which have been kindly afforded us by their respective authors; and we may remind the reader
  that these two designs were specially mentioned by the Building Committee in their Report already
  quoted. In the same place some interesting documents connected with the building will also be
  found, which we were unable to insert in the text.</p>

  DESIGNS.</span></p>

<hr style="width:10em"/>

  <p class="sp3">The following descriptions and plates of two of the designs sent in competition for
  the Building, and specially mentioned by the Committee in their Report, are given from information
  obligingly furnished to us by their respective authors.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">DESIGN BY M. HECTOR HOREAU, ARCHITECT, OF PARIS.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>This was one of the most striking of all that were submitted to the Commission; it formed one
    immense hall, or shed, more than 2000 feet long, by about 270 feet wide throughout, with several
    small detached buildings on the north side, for refreshments, &amp;c.</p>
    <p>The interior of the main building was divided into five avenues, the centre one about ninety
    feet wide, those next adjoining rather more than fifty feet, and the outside ones about forty
    feet wide. Iron columns, about twenty-three feet apart, formed these avenues and supported
    arched ribs for the roof. One end of the building was semicircular, the other forming an
    ornamental façade, and about the centre of the length a transept was formed.</p>
    <p>M. Horeau says: "Simplicity, grandeur, ready means of construction, and of increasing or
    diminishing the accommodation, and of removal if required, forming altogether a specimen of the
    most recent improvements introduced into the art of building&mdash;these are the principal
    objects which it has been sought to attain. The whole of the construction is of iron, without a
    single piece of wood, the foundation being executed in brick; the façade to be in metal,
    porcelain, and glass, the floor of asphalte, the roof to be principally covered with ornamental
    thick glass, in large dimensions, or ground glass with patterns.</p>
    <p>"Of the trusses or arched ribs supporting the roof there were to be but three varieties, each
    in three pieces, with which the whole of the building could be erected. This subdivision of the
    roof-trusses would have facilitated the conversion of the building for other purposes; for,
    taken singly, or in various combinations, they would have formed many kinds of buildings for
    ordinary purposes. The attached buildings placed on the north side would have shown several
    modes of effecting this. The ornamental spandrils of the roof-trusses would be formed in
    stamped-work out of copper, and gilt.</p>
    <p>"The façade shows at a glance the purpose of the building, as well as its <span
    class="pagenum" id="pagex">{x}</span>interior disposition, in which the different widths of
    avenues would afford space for objects of all varieties of dimensions. The façade itself was to
    be formed with tracery or trellis-work of cast-iron, the lower part being covered with
    sheet-iron; the cornice and ornamental panels of porcelain; the medallions in coloured
    stone-ware; the doors and inclosures of metal, silvered and gilt; the ornamental details to be
    either cast or stamped; the scrolls in the panels being in coloured glass or mosaic.</p>
    <p>"The pediment is crowned with a group of figures representing the Genius of Industry crowning
    the Arts and Sciences; in the cornice are placed the names of all the principal cities of the
    world, and the names of eminent men in panels. In the medallions are represented allegorical
    figures of the different branches of science and industry. At the angles of the building are
    placed trophies, the base of which would serve as guard-houses."</p>
    <p class="sp0">The engravings will serve to show the general effect of this design in its
    interior and exterior.</p>
  </div>

<hr style="width:6em"/>

  <p class="ac"><span class="smaller">DESIGN BY MESSRS. R. AND T. TURNER, OF DUBLIN.</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p>In this design also the interior was arranged as one uninterrupted space, about 1,940 feet
    long, and 408 wide, the roof in one span rising about 120 feet above the floor; the supports,
    consisting of semicircular ribs, forming the interior into three avenues, the centre one 200
    feet wide and the full height, the side ones 104 feet wide and about sixty feet high. In the
    centre of the length a transept was proposed, and the square area at the meeting of that with
    the central avenue was to be covered with a glass dome.</p>
    <p>The ends of the building, as well as those of the transept, were to be filled in with tracery
    in the upper part, a colonnade below protecting the entrances. Galleries, if necessary, were to
    be placed in the side avenues. The construction of this building was proposed to be principally
    of wrought iron, which would have given to the circular ribs and other parts a great lightness
    of effect; but, on the other hand, the difficulties of producing and putting together such an
    enormous amount of wrought-iron work in so short a space of time as that required was considered
    an almost insuperable objection to the design. Large portions of the roof were to be covered
    with glass, so as to admit an abundance of light into the interior.</p>
    <p class="sp0">The accompanying views of the exterior and interior of this design, from the
    simplicity of the arrangement, consisting of a repetition of similar parts, require but little
    description for their elucidation.</p>

  &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<hr style="width:6em"/>

  <p class="it1">Memorandum of the grounds on which the site has been selected for the Exhibition of
  1851, and of the proceedings which have been taken in consequence of that selection, prepared for
  the information of the Lords of the Treasury by the Royal Commissioners for promoting the
  Exhibition.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>1.  It is within the knowledge of the Lords of the Treasury, that from the time of the
    earliest announcement of the proposed Exhibition it has always been intended that it should take
    place in the Metropolis. Not only was such an intention matter of notoriety at the time that the
    question of issuing a Royal Commission was under consideration, but the Commission itself, when
    issued formally recited that it was proposed "To establish an Enlarged Exhibition of the Works
    of Industry of all Nations, to be holden in London, in the year 1851;" and it was to further the
    holding of such an exhibition that the present Commissioners were specially appointed.</p>
    <p>2.  Considering the importance of the undertaking, and the circumstances attending its
    promulgation, the selection of the Metropolis as its intended locality appears to have been both
    natural and proper. It will be borne in mind that the exhibitions which have from time to time
    been held in foreign countries have generally, and, as the Commissioners believe, invariably,
    been held in the capitals of the respective countries. In the present case it was peculiarly
    important that an undertaking which required the constant superintendence of a body of
    Commissioners, whose <span class="pagenum" id="pagexii">{xii}</span>occupations for the most
    part confine them to London, should be carried on within their immediate cognisance, and not
    removed to a distant situation.</p>
    <p>3.  It being thus distinctly evident that the Exhibition ought to take place in London, it is
    further obvious that the actual site which may be selected for it should be within the precincts
    of, or in the closest vicinity to, the most central and accessible parts of the Metropolis
    itself. It need hardly be pointed out that it would be objectionable to impose upon persons who
    may have come to London from a great distance the necessity of an additional journey to visit
    the Exhibition; a consideration which has already been urged upon the Commissioners by the
    representatives of several of the most important provincial towns, who are apprehensive of the
    inconvenience to which artizans in particular might thus be subjected. Moreover, the removal of
    the Exhibition to any distance sufficient to diminish the number of visitors would not only
    militate against its essential character of general accessibility, but might most seriously
    affect the receipts upon which its self-supporting character must depend, a point upon which it
    appears that much stress has been laid.</p>
    <p>4.  Although Hyde Park, and even the particular space now in question, had been already
    mentioned before the issue of the Commission, and indeed so far back as October, 1849, as a
    probable site for the Exhibition, it is unnecessary to assure the Lords of the Treasury that the
    Commissioners approached the question of the site after their appointment without having in any
    degree prejudged the merits of particular localities. On the 14th of February, their attention
    having been directed to the importance of determining the site by the Committee then recently
    appointed for all matters relating to the building, they deputed two Commissioners, namely, Lord
    Granville and Mr. Labouchere, to wait upon the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, and to
    confer with him upon the subject. The result of this conference is set forth in the Report
    presented by the Building Committee at the next meeting of the Commissioners (Feb. 21), of which
    the following is the portion which relates to the question of the site<span
    class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>
    <p>"With respect to the site, it has appeared to your Committee that, firstly, the north-eastern
    portion of Hyde Park; secondly, the long space between her Majesty's private road and the
    Kensington-road, in the southern part of Hyde Park; and, thirdly, the north-western portion of
    Regent's Park, are the only available spaces about the Metropolis which would afford the
    necessary accommodation; and it is believed that the order in which they have been named
    represents also their relative eligibility. As regards the first, the Committee are informed by
    the Chief Commissioner of her Majesty's Woods and Forests, that considerable objections would
    arise to its occupation for such a purpose, and that no such objections would be raised to the
    use of the second; the Committee, therefore, recommend the adoption of this site, which, amongst
    other advantages, is remarkable for the facility of access afforded by the existing roads. Upon
    this occasion a letter was received from the Westminster Committee, stating that the local
    Commissioners for Westminster had visited the site in Hyde Park, and a site suggested in the
    Regent's Park, and that they were of opinion that the site in Hyde Park was the preferable
    one."</p>
    <p>The recommendation of the Building Committee having been agreed to, a form of advertisement,
    requesting plans and suggestions for the building, was, at the next meeting (28th February),
    submitted for approbation, and was ordered to be immediately issued in the English, French, and,
    German languages. To this advertisement was appended a ground-plan of the site in Hyde Park for
    the guidance of those to whom the advertisement was addressed. The details of this plan were
    discussed in the presence of the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, and were settled in
    conformity with his lordship's wishes.</p>
    <p>5.  In consequence of the advertisement thus issued, no less than 248 plans and suggestions,
    many of them the productions of foreign artists, were sent in to the Commissioners. A large
    number of these were of a very elaborate character, and bore evident marks of considerable
    application and ability.</p>
    <p>6.  Soon after the site had been selected, some other important arrangements having also by
    this time been made, the Commissioners prepared and published a statement (21 February)
    explanatory of the nature and objects of the Exhibition, which was widely circulated in this
    country, was forwarded to our consuls abroad and to the foreign consuls in England, and was
    officially transmitted by the Secretary of State to all Foreign Governments, and to all the
    Governors of the British Colonies, as well as to India. In this statement it was announced that
    "Her Majesty had <span class="pagenum" id="pagexiii">{xiii}</span>been graciously pleased to
    grant a site for the purpose (of the Exhibition) on the south side of Hyde Park, lying between
    the Kensington Drive and the ride commonly called Rotten Row."</p>
    <p>7.  The site having been thus deliberately chosen and formally announced, all subsequent
    proceedings connected with the building have been taken with direct reference to it. The plans
    have been prepared with a view to its peculiarities, and the form of the building and its
    internal as well as its external arrangements have been determined by them. The amount of space
    available for the display of articles has been calculated upon the data afforded by the site,
    and from a calculation of this amount the Commissioners have been able to assign to each foreign
    country a definite space for the arrangement of its own productions. All the necessary
    working-drawings and specifications have been prepared with very great labour and at
    considerable expense, and have now been issued in a form which will insure to the Commissioners
    the certainty of obtaining, within a few days, <i>bonâ fide</i> tenders for the execution of a
    design presenting every facility for construction within the time prescribed. The mechanical
    difficulties have been surmounted, and all the preliminary arrangements, even to the extent of
    provision for an effective drainage and a sufficient water supply, have been entered into. The
    whole of these preparations have reference to this particular site only, and are inapplicable or
    unsuitable to any other.</p>
    <p>8.  From what has been already stated, it will be seen that the present site was not selected
    without consideration, and that the proceedings which have been taken with respect to it were
    not commenced until the Commissioners had good ground for believing that there would be no
    objection to its occupation. The attention, however, which has lately been directed to the
    point, has caused them anxiously to reconsider the whole subject, and renders it now necessary
    for them to enter into somewhat more of detail as to the grounds upon which they have come to
    the conclusion which they have formed, that this is the only site in or about the Metropolis
    which is at once suitable and practically available for the purposes of the Exhibition.</p>
    <p>9.  Of the other sites which have been suggested, the following are the only ones deserving
    of particular consideration<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>(<i>a</i>) The North-eastern portion of Hyde Park.</p>
      <p>(<i>b</i>) The North-western portion of Regent's Park.</p>
      <p>(<i>c</i>) Battersea Park.</p>
      <p>(<i>d</i>) Victoria Park.</p>
      <p>(<i>e</i>) Wormwood Scrubbs.</p>
    </div>
    <p>10.  The north-eastern portion of Hyde Park would, in the opinion of many members of the
    Building Committee, be a very eligible situation; but, as has been already mentioned, an
    objection was taken to this locality on the part of the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, on
    the ground that the building would interfere with some important thoroughfares in that part of
    the park, and on account of other considerations of public importance; and the idea was
    abandoned in consequence.</p>
    <p>11.  The site suggested in the Regent's Park has been found, since it was visited by the
    Building Committee, not to be available, as the leases under which the houses in the
    neighbourhood are held contain a clear and stringent provision that no new building of any kind
    shall be erected within the limits of the park.</p>
    <p>12.  With regard to the ground in the neighbourhood of Battersea proposed to be purchased by
    the Government, and to be converted into a park to be called Battersea Park, the Lords of the
    Treasury are of course aware that only a small proportion of the whole area has as yet been
    purchased; and the Commissioners found on inquiry that this proportion consists of numerous
    small detached pieces, utterly insufficient to accommodate a building of the contemplated size,
    and separated from each other by intervening plots of ground, many of them in a state of high
    cultivation, and belonging to a great number of different proprietors, with whom it would be
    absolutely impossible to effect arrangements within any time which would afford the slightest
    chance of the Commissioners being put in possession of a site in time to complete their building
    by the spring of next year. It should be added that the site of this district is very low, a
    great portion of it being some feet under high-water mark, and that the nature of the soil
    presents serious objections to its use as a building-ground.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexiv">{xiv}</span></div>
    <p>13.  Victoria Park is situated in an inconvenient and not very accessible part of the town.
    It would, moreover, be impossible to erect in it a building of the required size without most
    seriously interfering with the plantations and ornamental water which have been recently laid
    out there; thus inflicting on the classes for whose recreation that park has been opened an
    inconvenience infinitely more serious than could be caused to the frequenters of the very much
    larger area of Hyde Park by the proposed occupation of a comparatively small portion of it.</p>
    <p>14.  Lastly, as regards Wormwood Scrubbs, besides that the distance is a very serious
    objection, the rights of the commoners in that locality would prevent its appropriation; and the
    Commissioners are advised that it would be impossible to erect the building there without risk,
    as any single commoner would have it in his power to interrupt the proceedings, and to cause
    them to be discontinued at any stage of the work, however advanced. Similar objections apply to
    Wandsworth and some other commons in the neighbourhood of London, which have been occasionally
    mentioned as possible sites.</p>
    <p>14<i>a</i>. As regards Primrose Hill and the Isle of Dogs, the want of level space on the
    former, and the objectionable situation and dampness of the latter, render them so obviously
    unsuitable as to make any particular observations unnecessary.</p>
    <p>15.  But even could the objections to any of these sites be removed, or could another and an
    unobjectionable site be pointed out, the Commissioners feel hound to state, from their
    experience of the time, thought, and labour necessarily consumed in the investigation,
    arrangement, and preparation of the great mass of detail requisite to enable them to carry out
    this extensive work, that they are fully convinced of the impossibility of now adapting their
    plans to any other site, with any reasonable prospect of being able to complete the work within
    the time to which they stand pledged in the face of the world; and they could only regard a
    change of site, particularly if it should involve a change of plan, as tantamount to the
    postponement of the Exhibition till another year. And the Commissioners cannot shut their eyes
    to the fact, that a postponement of the Exhibition would, under the circumstances, certainly
    lead to its entire abandonment.</p>
    <p>16.  In order to give the Lords of the Treasury some idea of the consequences of an
    abandonment of this scheme, the Commissioners would in the first place direct their attention to
    the large amount of money already subscribed towards its completion (which is at present nearly
    64,000<i>l</i>.), to the number of local committees (now about 240) which have been called into
    existence throughout the country, to the funds now being raised by subscriptions out of their
    wages among the working-classes in all parts of the country towards enabling them to visit an
    Exhibition to which they are anxiously looking forward, and the abandonment of which would be a
    great disappointment to numbers, and still more to the extensive preparations which are now
    making for the supply of articles for exhibition. It is within the knowledge of the
    Commissioners that several individuals in this country have incurred several thousand pounds'
    expense in such preparations, besides the anxiety which they have occasioned.</p>
    <p>17.  But the evils which would result from postponement, so far as this country is concerned,
    are as nothing when compared with those which would arise in the case of foreign nations and the
    colonies. The plan of the Exhibition has been widely circulated for several months, and the
    following States have already signified, through their respective Governments, that they have
    appointed Committees or Commissioners, consisting of the most distinguished individuals in those
    countries, to co-operate with the Royal Commissioners in this country<span

    <p>Besides which it may be mentioned that special Commissioners have been sent to this country
    by France, Russia, and one or two other States; and that in most cases the Governments have
    <span class="pagenum" id="pagexv">{xv}</span>undertaken the collection and the transmission to
    this country, at their own expense, of the articles intended for exhibition, for which, of
    course, their preparations are now made.</p>
    <p>18.  In all the countries which have been mentioned active preparations for the Exhibition
    are now going on, and in some considerable expense is known to have been incurred. The Russian
    Government has announced that the goods intended for exhibition will be shipped from that
    country in the autumn of this year, and questions pointing to a similar arrangement have
    recently been put by the Government of Denmark. The Austrian Government have given notice, that
    the Great Exhibition which was to have been held at Vienna in the year 1851 has been postponed
    till the year 1852, in order not to clash with the Exhibition in London. All these circumstances
    tend to show that the postponement of the Exhibition would be seriously inconvenient to many
    countries, and would probably occasion considerable and natural irritation at what would appear
    like national vacillation, besides the certainty of rendering these countries unwilling to run
    the risk of a second disappointment, and of deterring them from continuing their preparations
    for a later period.</p>
    <p>19.  These inconveniences would be felt also by the British Colonies. Committees have been
    announced as formed in Malta, Ceylon, Nova Scotia, Barbadoes, Guiana, and several of the West
    India Islands, and it is probable that others have been appointed elsewhere. In India most
    extensive preparations are being made, and the East India Company have incurred very great
    expense by their exertions to contribute to the Exhibition.</p>
    <p>20.  After what has been said, it is unnecessary that the Commissioners should enlarge any
    further upon the consequences to be apprehended from the postponement which would be occasioned
    by an alteration of the site of building. They will proceed to offer a few remarks upon some of
    the objections which have been taken to that at present proposed.</p>
    <p>21.  An idea appears to prevail in some quarters that the occupation of the Park is intended
    to be of a permanent, and not, as has been repeatedly announced, of a merely temporary
    character, and the Commissioners are given to understand that by proposing to construct a
    building into which a good deal of brickwork is to enter, they have shown an intention at
    variance with their professions. Upon this point they have to remark, in the first place, that,
    although the eminent architects and engineers whom they have consulted, and to whom they have
    uniformly given instructions to prepare plans suitable to a temporary structure, have agreed to
    recommend the use of brick and other durable materials, they have left it perfectly open to
    contractors to send in their tenders for the execution of the work in any material or materials
    whatsoever, and have notified their readiness to entertain such tenders, on the single condition
    of their being "accompanied by working-drawings and specifications, and fully priced bills of
    quantities." It is probable that some such tenders will be made, and if made they will be
    impartially considered; but the Commissioners must protest against the supposition that it is
    necessarily more judicious to construct a temporary building of perishable than of enduring
    materials. The first requisite of the building is, that it should be suitable for its purpose,
    capable of protecting the valuable goods deposited in it from injury of every kind&mdash;as, for
    instance, from the weather, from the effects of the dampness of the soil, from the danger of
    fire, and so forth, and that it should be strong enough to avert all risk of accidental damage.
    Its next requisite is, that it should be economical, and in estimating its cost regard must be
    had not only to the expense of erection, but to the facility of removal and the value of the
    materials when removed, as a building may easily be conceived to be cheaper which should cost
    100,000<i>l.</i> to erect, but of which the materials could afterwards be sold for
    50,000<i>l.</i>, than another would be which cost but 80,000<i>l.</i> in the first instance, but
    of which the materials should become so far deteriorated as to produce only 20,000<i>l.</i> when
    taken down. It is the opinion of those who have devised the plans in the present case, that a
    building constructed of durable materials will in the end be cheaper than one constructed of
    such as are more perishable; particularly as a considerable portion of the building, namely, the
    iron roofing, will be of a kind which is generally used in the construction of railway-stations,
    and will probably be disposed of for that purpose after the close of the Exhibition, as its
    temporary application to the purposes of the Exhibition will be of no detriment to its being so.
    An opportunity of testing the correctness of this opinion will be given when the tenders are
    received, as, in addition to the customary form, it has been required that they should also be
    sent upon the understanding that the materials shall <span class="pagenum"
    id="pagexvi">{xvi}</span>remain the property of the contractor, and shall in fact only be hired
    for the purposes of the Exhibition. The third requisite of the building is, that it should be at
    least seemly, though it may not be necessary that it should be highly ornamental. The
    Commissioners trust that it will fulfil this condition, while they would at the same time point
    out that no expense is to be incurred for merely ornamental purposes, unless it should be
    thought desirable to select a dome for covering in the large space which must necessarily be
    left in the centre of the building to suit the internal arrangements. A cheaper mode of covering
    in this space will probably be resorted to, and the Commissioners have directed that a special
    estimate of the cost of the dome should be laid before them when the tenders are complete, in
    order that they may judge of the propriety of sanctioning its erection.</p>
    <p>Having offered this short explanation, they can only repeat once more the assurances they
    have already given, that the building is not intended to be permanent, and that it will be
    entirely removed, in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the Lords of the Treasury on
    yielding up the site, within seven months after the closing of the Exhibition, which cannot be
    deferred after the 1st of November, and will probably take place at an earlier period in the
    autumn of next year.</p>
    <p>22.  Another ground of apprehension is stated to be, lest the Park should be injured by the
    erection of the building, and the injury should continue after the structure is removed. This
    apprehension is, however, groundless; a small clump of ten trees has been allowed to be removed,
    in compensation for which, it is proposed by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to plant
    another clump elsewhere. It is not intended to cut down any more than that clump. As regards the
    surface of the ground to be occupied, it will not only not be injured, but will ultimately be
    materially improved by being drained and freshly sown with grass seed. It will be a strict
    condition with the contractors for the building that they shall, on its removal, restore the
    ground to its present condition.</p>
    <p>23.  Some dissatisfaction has been expressed at the prospect of a furnace being erected to
    heat the boiler and drive the steam-apparatus. It is however, intended to construct such furnace
    on the principle of consuming its own smoke, or to burn coke instead of coal, should that, upon
    the whole, appear the best mode of preventing annoyance. Care will also be taken not to erect
    any chimney of an unsightly character.</p>
    <p>24. As regards the amount of traffic which will be occasioned by the transport of materials
    and goods to the site, the Commissioners have been furnished by the Building Committee with an
    approximate estimate that it will not in the whole exceed the ordinary amount of three weeks'
    general traffic of a single railway-station, and as this traffic will be spread over a period of
    more than six months, it is manifest that its amount has been enormously exaggerated by public
    estimation.</p>
    <p>25.  The Queen's Ride, though in the immediate vicinity of the site, will not be in any
    degree interfered with, except that it may be advisable to rail off a strip not exceeding ten
    feet, or one-sixth of the whole in width, for foot-passengers, in order to prevent the
    inconvenience of crowding the space open to riding parties. By this arrangement the riders will
    be secured from annoyance.</p>
    <p>25 <i>a.</i> It has been said that the effect of the erection of the building will be to
    drive the inhabitants of London out of their Parks. The Commissioners think it right to draw the
    attention of the Lords of the Treasury to the following statistics<span

    <p>making a total of 1,568 acres, while only twenty acres are proposed to be taken or the
    purposes of this Exhibition.</p>
    <p>26.  In conclusion, the Commissioners think it desirable to call attention to the fact, that
    the three last Exhibitions of this nature which have taken place in Paris have been held on a
    site (the Champs Elysées) very closely corresponding to our own Hyde Park in many respects, and
    <span class="pagenum" id="pagexvii">{xvii}</span>particularly resembling it in being the most
    fashionable and the most frequented promenade in Paris&mdash;more frequented, indeed, than the
    particular spot selected on the present occasion has ever been, or is likely to be; and yet it
    does not appear that the Parisians have had occasion to complain of those annoyances which are
    now apprehended by some persons in this country. And the Commissioners are informed, that the
    Exhibition in Vienna was held in the Prado, the principal public place in that city; and that
    the Exhibition in Berlin was held in the Thiergarten, which is not only the principal public
    place within the city, but is remarkable as being the only open Park of any sort within several
    miles.</p>
    <p>27.  In the foregoing observations the Commissioners have thought it right to confine
    themselves strictly to a discussion of the practical difficulties which would attend a change of
    site. They cannot, however, but express their decided opinion, that the renouncement of the
    selection of the most beautiful park in London for the scene of the Exhibition may be looked
    upon as indicating a diminution of interest in the undertaking, and would materially detract
    from that appearance of hospitality on the part of England which has been one great cause for
    the very favourable reception which this proposal has everywhere secured.</p>
    <p class="sp0">They must add, that the possibility that the bringing the Exhibition into Hyde
    Park should be considered as an interference with the enjoyment of that Park by the public has
    never entered their minds. They have, on the contrary, always intended it as a means of
    recreative and intellectual enjoyment for the greatest portion of her Majesty's subjects: and
    they have hitherto had reason to believe that it has been so regarded by the country in
    general.</p>

  COMMISSIONERS,</span></p>

  <p class="ac">PRESENTED TO HER MAJESTY ON THE OPENING OF THE BUILDING.</p>

  <p>The following Report, together with her Majesty's Answer, on the occasion of the inauguration
  of the building, cannot fail to be interesting as a brief record of the proceedings connected with
  this noble undertaking up to that period<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp2">
    <p>"May it please your Majesty,&mdash;We, the Commissioners appointed by your Majesty's royal
    warrant of the 3rd of January, 1850, for the promotion of the Exhibition of the Works of
    Industry of all Nations, and subsequently incorporated by your Majesty's Royal Charter of the
    15th of August in the same year, humbly beg leave, on the occasion of your Majesty's auspicious
    visit at the opening of the Exhibition, to lay before you a brief statement of our proceedings
    to the present time.</p>
    <p>"By virtue of the authority graciously committed to us by your Majesty, we have made diligent
    inquiry into the matters which your Majesty was pleased to refer to us, namely, into the best
    mode of introducing the productions of your Majesty's colonies and of foreign countries into
    this kingdom, the selection of the most suitable site for the Exhibition, the general conduct of
    the undertaking, and the proper method of determining the nature of the prizes and of securing
    the most impartial distribution of them.</p>
    <p>"In the prosecution of these inquiries, and in the discharge of the duties assigned to us by
    your Majesty's Royal Charter of Incorporation, we have held constant meetings of our whole body,
    and have, moreover, referred numerous questions connected with a great variety of subjects to
    committees, composed partly of our own members and partly of individuals distinguished in the
    several departments of science and the arts, who have cordially responded to our applications
    for their assistance at a great sacrifice of their valuable time.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexviii">{xviii}</span></div>
    <p>"Among the earliest questions brought before us was the important one as to the terms upon
    which articles offered for exhibition should be admitted into the building. We considered that
    it was a main characteristic of the national undertaking in which we were engaged that it should
    depend wholly upon the voluntary contributions of the people of this country for its success;
    and we therefore decided, without hesitation, that no charge whatever should be made on the
    admission of such goods. We considered, also, that the office of selecting the articles to be
    sent should be intrusted in the first instance to local committees, to be established in every
    foreign country, and in various districts of your Majesty's dominions; a general power of
    control being reserved to the Commission.</p>
    <p>"We have now the gratification of stating that our anticipations of support in this course
    have in all respects been fully realised. Your Majesty's most gracious donation to the funds of
    the Exhibition was the signal for voluntary contributions from all, even the humblest, classes
    of your subjects, and the funds which have thus been placed at our disposal amount at present to
    about 65,000<i>l.</i> Local committees, from which we have uniformly received the most zealous
    co-operation, were formed in all parts of the United Kingdom, in many of your Majesty's
    colonies, and in the territories of the Hon. East India Company. The most energetic support has
    also been received from the Governments of nearly all the countries of the world, in most of
    which Commissions have been appointed for the special purpose of promoting the objects of an
    Exhibition justly characterised in your Majesty's royal warrant as an Exhibition of the Works of
    Industry of all Nations.</p>
    <p>"We have also to acknowledge the great readiness with which persons of all classes have come
    forward as exhibitors. And here again it becomes our duty to return our humble thanks to your
    Majesty for the most gracious manner in which your Majesty has condescended to associate
    yourself with your subjects by yourself contributing some most valuable and interesting articles
    to the Exhibition.</p>
    <p>"The number of exhibitors whose productions it has been found possible to accommodate is
    about 15,000, of whom nearly one-half are British. The remainder represent the productions of
    more than forty foreign countries, comprising almost the whole of the civilised nations of the
    globe. In arranging the space to be allotted to each, we have taken into consideration both the
    nature of its productions and the facilities of access to this country afforded by its
    geographical position. Your Majesty will find the productions of your Majesty's dominions
    arranged in the western portion of the building, and those of foreign countries in the eastern.
    The Exhibition is divided into the four great classes of&mdash;1, Raw Materials; 2, Machinery;
    3, Manufactures; and 4, Sculpture and the Fine Arts. A further division has been made according
    to the geographical position of the countries represented; those which lie within the warmer
    latitudes being placed near the centre of the building, and the colder countries at the
    extremities.</p>
    <p>"Your Majesty having been graciously pleased to grant a site in this your royal Park for the
    purposes of the Exhibition, the first column of the structure now honoured by your Majesty's
    presence was fixed on the 26th of September last. Within the short period, therefore, of seven
    months, owing to the energy of the contractors and the active industry of the workmen employed
    by them, a building has been erected, entirely novel in its construction, covering a space of
    more than eighteen acres, measuring 1,851 feet in length, and 456 feet in extreme breadth,
    capable of containing 40,000 visitors, and affording a frontage for the exhibition of goods to
    the extent of more than ten miles. For the original suggestion of the principle of this
    structure the Commissioners are indebted to Mr. Joseph Paxton, to whom they feel their
    acknowledgments to be justly due for this interesting feature of their undertaking.</p>
    <p>"With regard to the distribution of rewards to deserving exhibitors, we have decided that
    they should be given in the form of medals, not with reference to merely individual competition,
    but as rewards for excellence in whatever shape it may present itself. The selection of the
    persons to be so rewarded has been intrusted to juries equally composed of British subjects and
    of foreigners, the former having been selected by the Commission from the recommendations made
    by the local committees, and the latter by the Governments of the foreign nations the
    productions of which are exhibited. The names of these jurors, comprising, as they do, many of
    European celebrity, afford the best guarantee of the impartiality with which the rewards will be
    assigned.</p>
    <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexix">{xix}</span></div>
    <p>"It affords much gratification that, notwithstanding the magnitude of this undertaking, and
    the great distances from which many of the articles now exhibited have had to be collected, the
    day on which your Majesty has been graciously pleased to be present at the inauguration of the
    Exhibition is the same day that was originally named for its opening, thus affording a proof of
    what may, under God's blessing, be accomplished by goodwill and cordial co-operation among
    nations, aided by the means that modern science has placed at our command.</p>
    <p class="sp0">"Having thus briefly laid before your Majesty the results of our labours, it now
    only remains for us to convey to your Majesty our dutiful and loyal acknowledgments of the
    support and encouragement which we have derived throughout this extensive and laborious task
    from the gracious favour and countenance of your Majesty. It is our heartfelt prayer that this
    undertaking, which has for its end the promotion of all branches of human industry and the
    strengthening of the bonds of peace and friendship among all nations of the earth, may, by the
    blessing of Divine Providence, conduce to the welfare of your Majesty's people, and be long
    remembered among the brightest circumstances of your Majesty's peaceful and happy reign."</p>
  </div>

  <p>Her Majesty returned the following gracious answer:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p>"I receive with the greatest satisfaction the address which you have presented to me on the
    opening of this Exhibition.</p>
    <p>"I have observed with a warm and increasing interest the progress of your proceedings in the
    execution of the duties intrusted to you by the Royal Commission, and it affords me sincere
    gratification to witness the successful result of your judicious and unremitting exertions in
    the splendid spectacle by which I am this day surrounded.</p>
    <p class="sp0">"I cordially concur with you in the prayer, that by God's blessing this
    undertaking may conduce to the welfare of my people and to the common interest of the human
    race, by encouraging the arts of peace and industry, strengthening the bonds of union among the
    nations of the earth, and promoting a friendly and honourable rivalry in the useful exercise of
    those faculties which have been conferred by a beneficent Providence for the good and the
    happiness of mankind."</p>

  <p class="ac">OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</p>

  <div class="bq1 smaller sp3">
    <p class="ac">ATHENÆUM.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A well-written volume. A useful record of the history and progressive
    development of the marking incident of our age and nation. Mr. Berlyn was, we believe,
    officially employed by the Executive Committee in the earlier stages of their labours; his
    statements, therefore, are on good authority and may be relied on. The narrative is sufficiently
    full in its details for the general public now and hereafter."</p>
    <p class="ac">EXAMINER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This is a clever book, full of timely and interesting matter, and with
    sufficient merit as a record of the origin and history of the Great Exhibition to outlive the
    mere curiosity of the hour. Mr. Berlyn has had official opportunities of becoming well
    acquainted with the subject, and has not neglected them. He puts his materials together with
    spirit and intelligence, and indulges a hopeful strain of anticipation and prophecy very
    properly befitting his theme."</p>
    <p class="ac">LITERARY GAZETTE.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Within a small compass we have here gathered together all that is interesting in
    connexion with the great undertaking of the present year&mdash;an undertaking which must form a
    most important chapter in the world's history. We are bound to say that the work has been
    judiciously done, and the result is a very satisfactory review of all that has been effected in
    the way of Industrial Exhibitions up to the present time."</p>
    <p class="ac">MORNING CHRONICLE.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"<span class="sc">Gilbert's Popular Narrative of the
    Exhibition.</span>&mdash;With this title a small work has just been published, written by Mr.
    Peter Berlyn, from authentic and official sources, tracing the origin, history, and progress,
    and pointing to the prospects, of the Great Exhibition. The author has carefully avoided all
    speculation and gossip on the subject, and has applied himself with very considerable ability to
    the statement and elucidation of all those facts, derived from authentic records, which bear
    upon the progress of this most important national movement. Many interesting facts are stated in
    connexion with the previous expositions which have taken place on the Continent and in this
    country, and the difficulties with which, upon its first announcement, the present undertaking
    had to contend, and the means by which the Executive were enabled to overcome them, are clearly
    and consecutively stated. The work also contains some valuable statistical and other information
    connected with the building, and copies of the most recent of the regulations issued by the
    Executive. We would cordially recommend this very interesting work."</p>
    <p class="ac">EXPOSITOR.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"The volume before us has fair claim to its title of a Narrative of the
    Exhibition. It commences with an account of such British and foreign exhibitions as may be
    supposed to have led to the idea of the great international show of industry to be held in the
    present year. The work also contains a complete account of how the world's industrial products
    have come to be housed in the present building; gives all the rules and orders of the
    Commissioners and Executive Committee; special instructions to colonial and foreign exhibitors
    and Custom-house authorities; names of authorised agents for foreign countries; Custom-house
    agents recommended by the Royal Commissioners; and such other information as renders it a really
    useful volume of practical information to all exhibitors and visitors at the Exhibition."</p>
    <p class="ac">SUN.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Within the compass of an elegant pocket-volume the author of the present
    narrative has contrived to furnish his readers with a very copious history of the origin,
    progress, and prospects of the Great Exhibition. Throughout the work he has written with an
    especial regard at once to simplicity and perspicuity, so that we rest satisfied his labours
    will prove eminently successful, the book being incontestibly <i>the</i> narrative of the Great
    Industrial Exposition. Beginning with all the preliminary particulars, which are absolutely
    essential for the comprehension of the entire scheme of the Prince Consort, the narrative
    describes very lucidly the growth of the first crude idea to its present gigantic dimensions.
    The share taken in the project by the Society of Arts is duly celebrated, and the influence of
    the successive expositions of French industry especially notified. The volume is altogether a
    very clever and most complete work."</p>
    <p class="ac">WEEKLY DISPATCH.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Works upon the above subject will become highly popular from the very necessity
    of the case; and consequently that which the public must chiefly look for amidst all the
    competition that will ensue will be correctness and compactness combined with economy. Mr. Peter
    Berlyn's book combines every requisite information regarding the Exhibition from first to last.
    Its clever compilation, tasteful form, quantity and variety of information, and the dependance
    that may be placed upon it for correctness, combine with its early appearance to render it one
    of the most valuable hand-books that are likely to be generally used."</p>
    <p class="ac">ART JOURNAL.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A very useful and sound history of the rise and progress of the Great
    International Exhibition of 1851, in which the first movements towards it are carefully and ably
    detailed; and a very good analysis is given of all preceding industrial exhibitions, at home and
    abroad, as well as a large amount of information connected with the construction of the building
    itself, and abstracts of official documents connected with the entire movement. The author has
    done justice to the efforts which have been made to interest the English manufacturer, and
    stimulate him in his artistic endeavours; and we feel bound to acknowledge his courteous notice
    of the exertions made by 'The Art Journal' in helping forward its consummation in 1851."</p>
    <p class="ac">LEADER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"For those who wish to know all about the rise and progress of the Great
    Exhibition and its Crystal Palace this neat hand-book is the very thing. Mr. Berlyn has
    performed his task with laudable industry. He has drawn together and arranged a large amount of
    scattered information regarding the Exhibition in a pleasant form. As an elegant and trustworthy
    hand-book, the narrative deserves to be popular."</p>
    <p class="ac">OBSERVER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This neat volume gives a history of previous Exhibitions&mdash;some on small,
    some on large scales&mdash;that have taken place in divers parts of Europe of late years. It
    then points out the precise origin of the Exhibition of all Nations, snowing the share his Royal
    Highness Prince Albert had in it; its history and progress are thus minutely detailed, and its
    prospects are foreshadowed without exaggeration. We cordially recommend it as a pocket-companion
    necessary to all those who have not as yet mastered the chief facts connected with the erection
    of the Palace of Industry."</p>
    <p class="ac">JOHN BULL.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"An able and complete history of the scheme, which we have all to accept as <i>un
    fait accompli</i>, and a useful guide to the transparent mazes of the Crystal Palace."</p>
    <p class="ac">WEEKLY NEWS.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Of the works already published, and professing to treat of this gigantic
    undertaking in its national, social, scientific, and artistic light, we have not met with one so
    completely pervaded by a spirit of universality as this book of Mr. Berlyn's. In matters of
    detail and relation his narrative is explicit and lucid; where he has touched on the history of
    an art or a manufacture he is correct in his data; and in tracing the Exhibition to its true
    source he has displayed a highly philosophical insight into the spirit of the age. Within the
    pages of his book will be found a faithful record of the most important meetings of the Royal
    Commissioners, as well as those convened by the corporations of cities, by societies, or by
    private individuals, for the furtherance of the great work in hand. To these is appended a
    verbatim report of the speeches delivered at these meetings by the distinguished men who were
    invited to preside over them; and the enlightened, liberal, and hopeful spirit which pervades
    their addresses forms a cheerful contrast to the ominous predictions of certain political and
    theological fanatics. After a full discussion of what may be termed the <i>business</i> portion
    of the subject, Mr. Berlyn closes his excellent little book with a brief but eloquent and
    comprehensive consideration of the beneficial results which are likely to accrue from this great
    national undertaking, not only to ourselves but mankind in general. The entire absence of
    partiality or prejudice throughout the book, and the very interesting information contained in
    it for all matters directly or indirectly connected with the Exhibition, induce us to recommend
    the author to publish editions of it in the French and German languages. By this means he would
    be conferring a boon on our country's guests."</p>
    <p class="ac">LADY'S NEWSPAPER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Mr. Peter Berlyn has produced a well arranged, clear, and concise hand book to
    this wonder of the world, in which he traces its origin, progress, and prospects, in a pleasing
    and interesting manner. This must have been a most difficult task, as the materials out of which
    he has formed his narrative are so widely scattered that it requires some one who perfectly and
    profoundly understands the subject (as we are convinced Mr. Berlyn does) to collect and arrange
    them in so satisfactory a manner. The ladies also will hail this work with pleasure, because,
    though containing every information on the subject, it is at the same time light, interesting,
    and infinitely superior to the dry and prosy style usually adopted in similar works. It is
    tastefully illustrated, has an elegant fancy binding, and forms a guide-book either for the
    library or the pocket."</p>
    <p class="ac">NOTES AND QUERIES.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A volume carefully compiled from authentic sources of information upon the
    several points set forth in its ample title page."</p>
    <p class="ac">GARDENER AND FARMERS' JOURNAL.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"We do not go out of our province as horticultural journalists in noticing a work
    recently issued by Mr. Gilbert, of Paternoster-row. Our friends in the provinces will do well to
    study beforehand as many of the probable incidents of their trip as possible; and, though
    innumerable prints and tabular descriptions of the Exhibition Building have been issued, we have
    not had anything before like a connected history of the great project itself. The work before us
    is called 'A Popular Narrative of the Origin, History, Progress, and Prospects of the Great
    Exhibition of 1851; and we think the author, Mr. Berlyn, has treated his subject in perfect
    accordance with the title. More than this it is quite unnecessary to say as to the merits of the
    work; but we may just notice that the 'getting-up' has evidently been intrusted to careful
    hands. The binding is neat and tasteful, and, besides a ground-plan, a perspective view of the
    building is given."</p>
    <p class="ac">MINING JOURNAL.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This volume, which unostentatiously treats on the highly interesting subjects
    indicated in the title, is based on records of unimpeachable value. All speculation has been
    wisely avoided, and its pages present an unvarnished history of one of the most extraordinary
    undertakings of which the history of the world can boast; extraordinary in the fact of the
    people of this little island challenging the people of the universe to meet on its shores with
    specimens of their several productions of industry; and extraordinary in the magnitude,
    decidedly novel, and inconceivably rapid erection of the building for their reception. The
    history of every similar exhibition is traced back to its source; those of Manchester,
    Birmingham, London, and France are minutely recorded; the growing interest which followed every
    subsequent exposition statistically described, and every detail connected with the Royal
    Commission, the arrangements, the building, future rules, throughout a space of 200 pages, and
    finishing with a list of the local committees, conveys a vivid and correct picture of this vast
    national undertaking."</p>
    <p class="ac">CHURCH AND STATE GAZETTE.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A work that was wanted. It puts the public in full possession of every iota of
    intelligence in connexion with the Great Exhibition worth having, and has some very sensible
    remarks on the prospects of home exhibitors, especially at the forthcoming display. It is
    indispensable to all interested in the subject."</p>
    <p class="ac">GUARDIAN.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"'A Popular Narrative of the Great Exhibition' was really needed, explaining its
    whole history from its first conception in the Prince Consort's brain, and Mr. Berlyn's book has
    amply supplied the need. It is a very smart volume, and the writer is duly impressed with the
    grandeur of his theme."</p>
    <p class="ac">LEIGH HUNT'S JOURNAL.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"We can hardly speak too highly of this elegant and useful volume. Mr. Berlyn has
    done his part admirably, and the publisher has seconded him in the business department no less
    satisfactorily. All the floating and disconnected accounts that have hitherto been brought
    before the public from time to time are here collected and arranged in a very popular and lucid
    manner, while a mass of fresh information, entirely new and authentic, renders this book the
    only complete compendium of the Exhibition in all its bearings. The history of its origin is
    written with a graphic power and a narrative vigour very surprising on such a subject. You are
    carried along with as much interest as if reading a work of fiction. The contents fully justify
    the ample title, and in that tact lies more of eulogy than columns of praise could say."</p>
    <p class="ac">THE EVENING EXPRESS.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A neatly-printed volume on the History of the Exhibition; containing a careful
    digest of all the documents which the Commissioners have issued."</p>
    <p class="ac">THE TABLET.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Mr. Berlyn's book is an elegant volume by way of a guide to the Crystal Palace.
    It contains a well-condensed summary on everything connected with the subject of the
    Exhibition."</p>
    <p class="ac">MORNING ADVERTISER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A gaily-boarded volume, nattily emblazoned on the outside with colours, with a
    tinted frontispiece of the Glass House from the same familiar aspect. It is dedicated to Prince
    Albert, and contains an elaborate introduction, in which the by-past expositions of Paris,
    Birmingham, Manchester, Dublin, &amp;c. are duly noticed. It is as a whole a neat mode of
    preserving all the 'printed gossip,' as well as weightier reports of Commissioners, relating to
    the preparations of the shell of the Exhibition."</p>
    <p class="ac">MARK-LANE EXPRESS.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A most interesting record of the history and opinions as to the probable results
    of the World's Fair, to be held in the Crystal Palace, Hyde Park. The author has condensed into
    a most readable work every transaction which has given rise to this exhibition of the choice
    products of the world."</p>
    <p class="ac">THE BUILDER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This book gives, in a concise and agreeable manner, a narrative of the progress
    of the scheme towards fruition, and an account of the building. The account is put together
    pleasantly, and makes a pretty book."</p>
    <p class="ac">CHRISTIAN TIMES.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A valuable and elegant introduction to the Great Industrial Exhibition. It
    contains much useful information, lucidly and carefully arranged."</p>
    <p class="ac">NORTHERN STAR.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Mr. Berlyn's book is all it professes to be. It contains an ample and popular
    narrative of the circumstances connected with the conception and ultimate realisation or the
    idea; and incidentally throws much light upon the progress and effects of similar exhibitions
    abroad. The author deserves the greatest credit for the lively, interesting, and accurate manner
    in which he has recorded all the leading events connected with the Exhibition. In doing this we
    are happy to perceive also that he has the manliness to do justice to those who first introduced
    the idea of such Exhibitions into this country, and who had to struggle with all the
    difficulties which usually dog the footsteps of innovators and inventors. The first exhibitions
    had to encounter prejudice and apathy, and the funds for carrying them out were comparatively
    small, and difficult to be procured; they had not the <i>prestige</i> of princely and titled
    names, to give them acceptance with the vulgar herd, who eagerly copy the fashion set by the
    great. They were the production of a pure love of art, and science, and industry, and a desire
    to promote the improvement of public taste and skill. One of the first promoters 'of the plan of
    National Expositions, similar to those on the Continent,' was Mr. George Wallis, formerly master
    of the Manchester School of Design; of whose exertions Mr. Berlyn makes honourable mention. It
    is exceedingly interesting to have presented at one view the gradual expansion of the original
    idea, through a succession of varied phases, to its ultimate development as an Exhibition of the
    Industry of all Nations. It appears clear that Prince Albert is entitled to the merit of giving
    it this cosmopolitan character; other exhibitions have always been either local, provincial, or
    national. The idea of making that of 1851 universal is due to the Prince Consort alone. The
    circumstances under which Mr. Paxton conceived the idea of the structure which now attracts the
    admiration of every beholder, in Hyde Park, read more like a sketch of the imagination than a
    sober reality; and the almost incredible rapidity with which the plan has been translated into a
    great fact is one of the proudest testimonies that can be borne to the industrial resources,
    skill and enterprise of this country. Of all the marvels that will be exhibited at the World's
    Fair next May, none will be so marvellous as the structure in which they are collected; and we
    confidently commend Mr. Berlyn's book as an agreeable companion and guide to every visitor, as
    well as a record of the growth of the Exhibition, well deserving of preservation on account of
    its intrinsic merits and historical value."</p>
    <p class="ac">MANCHESTER EXAMINER AND TIMES.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Mr. Berlyn (whom many of our readers will remember as an active and earnest
    promoter of the interests of our Athenæum, in his character of honorary secretary to that
    institution), having held an official situation in connexion with the Royal Commission for
    carrying out the business detail of the intended Exhibition, finds means to present us with an
    extremely able and instructive volume. His narrative is cleverly written, and affords ample
    information of the origin and progress of a movement which has already acquired a world-wide
    fame. The gradual advance of public opinion and feeling in reference to the study of art, and to
    the more general cultivation of a love for the ideal and the beautiful among the people, are
    care fully traced, and we have every reason to believe that credit is justly given to the humble
    but earnest workers in the cause."</p>
    <p class="ac">LEEDS MERCURY.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A popular narrative of the origin, history, progress, and prospects of the Great
    Exhibition, with a guide to the future rules and arrangements, by Peter Berlyn, has just been
    published by Gilbert, of Paternoster-row. It is a very able and useful volume, beautifully got
    up, and at a cheap rate."</p>
    <p class="ac">LEEDS TIMES.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Mr. Berlyn's book supplies a <i>desideratum</i>. It is the first attempt, so far
    as we know, to give a consecutive narrative of the circumstances which have given birth to the
    great design, whose realisation is to illustrate the history of the present year. He has done
    his work well. The narrative is entirely derived from authentic and official sources, to which
    Mr. Berlyn, from his connexion with the undertaking, had peculiar opportunities of access. The
    author regards the Exhibition, not as a sudden individual thought, but as the natural result of
    certain industrial ideas and tendencies which have been gradually developing themselves during
    several years; and this view leads him to trace the history of various prior exhibitions on a
    minor scale in this country, such as the polytechnic exhibitions in different towns, and the
    exhibitions of art and manufactures which have taken place, many years, in Manchester,
    Birmingham, and the metropolis. The proceedings more immediately connected with the great
    World's Exhibition now in preparation are then related from the commencement, and in a manner at
    once concise and complete. Finally, we have a full account of the rules and regulations
    determined on for the conduct of this remarkable undertaking. The volume contains several
    excellent illustrations, is tastefully bound, and in a portable form."</p>
    <p class="ac">LIVERPOOL COURIER.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This is an exceedingly interesting and useful book. It has been got up as a
    hand-book for the visitors to the Great Exhibition, but its object is more to give a condensed
    account of the history of the event than to serve as a guide within the building. The writer,
    who treats his subject most clearly and ably, enters into a brief narrative of all that has been
    hitherto done, in this and other countries, to foster national taste in connexion with these
    public displays. In our own countries he goes on, at length, into an investigation of what may
    be termed the initiatory exhibition lately held at Birmingham, and which, in its results, far
    exceeded the expectations of its founders. He also gives a concise history of the proceedings
    relative to the 'Palace of Glass,' from the time that its erection was a dreamy idea until it
    rose in its gigantic transparency to astonish the world."</p>
    <p class="ac">LIVERPOOL ALBION.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This is a book for the times and to the purpose. Its title-page tells with what
    object it has been written, and is well borne out by its contents. When we open it we find a
    concise and faithful account of the causes and progress of the world's gathering which is just
    upon us. In preparing his volume the author has taken care to avoid all 'culling of simples,'
    and to give only such information as may be depended upon, and which possesses more than
    ephemeral interest. It abounds also, in practical suggestions and philosophical observations. We
    will only say further that the publisher, although he does not puff the work by talking of
    giving it away, certainly comes as near as possible to that point in the price which he has
    fixed upon it. We can safely recommend it."</p>
    <p class="ac">BIRMINGHAM JOURNAL.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"A cleverly-written and carefully-condensed little volume, containing all that
    has been done, and much that should be known, respecting the great event of the year. The author
    culls with great judgment from the addresses delivered at various meetings held throughout the
    country; the regulations issued by the Executive Committee are also introduced. Altogether, a
    more complete record, within the same amount of space, it would be impossible to find; it
    confers great credit upon the writer, who in addition is evidently an enthusiast in the work
    about which he writes so well."</p>
    <p class="ac">LEICESTERSHIRE MERCURY.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"This volume should be in the hands of all who take an interest in the great
    event of this <i>annus mirabilis</i>, 1851. What it promises in the title-page it performs in
    those which follow. It contains an accurate and deeply interesting record of the causes and
    progress of the preparation for that gathering of the nations of the earth which we are about to
    witness, and chronicles all the official information on the subject which is worth preserving.
    The practical suggestions and observations to be found in it are greatly to the credit of the
    writer. We must also give our praise to the publisher, Mr. Gilbert, for the manner in which he
    has brought it out, and the low price at which he offers it to the buyer."</p>
    <p class="ac">LIVERPOOL TIMES.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"Of course we are already deluged with hand-books, guide-books, &amp;c., to the
    Exhibition. Such little works, properly compiled, will not only be interesting, but absolutely
    serviceable, to the country visitor. We have had oceans sent to us, varying in price as in
    truthfulness and English grammar. The best we have seen is a 'Popular Narrative of the
    Exhibition,' by Peter Berlyn, published by Gilbert, of Paternoster-row; a book distinguished not
    only by correctness and labour, but also by very considerable literary merit."</p>
    <p class="ac">LINCOLNSHIRE TIMES.</p>
    <p class="sp3">"What the flower-garden is to the bees, attracting them to gather honey from its
    sweets, the Grand Exhibition has been to many a candidate anxious to take his place in the ranks
    of authorship. The book before us is one of the proofs of its stimulating powers. It fully and
    ably accomplishes all which the title-page leads us to expect, setting forth the causes and
    progress of that wondrous festival of industry at which the world is to meet in Britannia's
    Crystal Palace. The information which it contains may be relied upon as derived from the best
    sources; the practical suggestions are valuable; and the observations are penned in a highly
    philosophical spirit. We can safely recommend the work to our readers, and we are quite certain
    that everybody who buys it will be satisfied that his money has been well laid out. We speak not
    from our own authority only, but have our verdict backed by the opinion of persons competent to
    pronounce upon the merits of the volume before us."</p>
    <p class="ac">INVERNESS COURIER.</p>
    <p class="sp0">"This little volume has a merit which belongs to but few books published in the
    present age. It is wanted. There has no doubt been a great deal written on the subject of which
    it treats, as well as a great deal spoken; but till now we have had only scattered and almost
    inaccessible information on the one hand, or mere catchpenny pamphlets on the other. Mr.
    Berlyn's excellence is, that he is honest; that his work fulfils the promise of its title-page.
    Officially connected from its outset with the great scheme which he describes, he has enjoyed
    peculiar facilities for this task, has known where to look for materials, and been able to judge
    of their relative usefulness and importance. Of these opportunities he has diligently availed
    himself, and the result is to be seen in the elegant book before us. Simple and popular in
    style, it is comprehensive and instructive in its contents; we therefore recommend it."</p>

    affording a well-digested outline, which should be carefully committed to memory, and afterwards
    filled up by means of oral instruction or reference to larger works. Lively chapters of

<hr style="width:10em"/>

  <p>Geographical Knowledge was to a considerable extent an essential necessity even in the early
  periods of our world, cultivated indeed at first for almost purely social purposes, yet in the
  same proportion as our progenitors increased in numbers, so also did their extended range of
  observation instil into their minds the necessity of more practical observations on the relative
  bearings of the districts through which they passed, noting at the same time the numerous changes
  of hill and dale, rivulet and stream, and the countless varieties of the wonderful products with
  which it pleased Almighty God to bless its various regions. Hence progressively arose the
  Topographical and Geographical Delineations with which the Scriptures abound; to a similar cause
  may also be traced the contributions which the savage tribes have at various periods of our
  World's History added to the branches of Geographical science.</p>

  <p>Now, in the same proportion as any people forming a Nation develope their commercial and
  intellectual strength, in the same ratio has it pleased Providence to render it necessary that its
  inhabitants should not only become acquainted with the Topographical and Geographical features,
  relative distances and bearings, of their own and neighbouring nations, but of every portion of
  the known world, even extending their researches to unknown regions. Indeed, no member of a
  commercial nation, especially in one where education is much diffused, is qualified to act his
  part aright as one of its people, unless he is able to form a tolerably accurate notion of the
  names of Nations, Places, Seas, Rivers, Mountains, &amp;c., their relative position and extent, as
  well as to learn how richly the Creator of the Earth has endowed them all with the means of
  ministering to those comforts and pleasures of which man in every state of society and climate so
  much stands in need.</p>

  <p>These reflections might be much extended, but the limits of a prospectus will not permit it.
  Suffice it to say that every Englishman, be he rich or poor, should have access to modern Maps of
  the various portions of the World, in order to possess the means of cultivating a knowledge of its
  divisions, the names of the chief Nations, Places, &amp;c. &amp;c., as well as to be able to form
  intellectual and commercial ideas of its numerous products, and the respective regions from whence
  come the countless varieties of foreign substances now in use among us as articles of ornament or
  necessity.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Now, though a Modern Atlas of the World is so essential to every family in this
  kingdom, still it has been almost limited in its possession, on account of the high price at which
  all really good and practical works have hitherto been issued. To remove this difficulty has been
  the principal motive which has induced the Proprietors of "<span class="sc">Philips' Penny Modern
  Atlas</span>" to issue a work which they feel satisfied will be universally admitted to be
  surprisingly cheap, and not surpassed in usefulness by any attempt hitherto made to extend the
  knowledge of Geography.</p>

  <p>The Editor of these Pamphlets deems it almost superfluous to dwell on the paramount importance
  of every respectable family possessing this volume of very special present and permanent interest.
  During the discussion of the exciting matters now at issue in this all-absorbing question, there
  can be no questioning the well-recognised fact that the possession of this copious and cheap
  volume is essential to every thoughtful and inquiring person in our beloved country. For those who
  are as yet unaware of the immense mass of interesting and important documents that are in its
  pages, <span class="smaller">AN INDEX OF ITS CONTENTS IS ISSUED FOR GRATUITOUS
  DISTRIBUTION</span>&mdash;this will abundantly testify to the fact; and the Editor, thinks it only
  necessary to state that, with scarcely an exception, the whole of the documents are printed,
  verbatim, as they originally appeared, and in very numerous cases they have had the additional
  advantage of the direct and special revision of the authors.</p>

  <p>The Editor expresses his conviction that all the important facts and documents relative to the
  "Roman Catholic Question" have appeared in the pages of these pamphlets. Doubtless, during the
  progress of the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill through the Houses of Parliament speeches of
  interest will be made; still the Editor thinks they will be merely elaborations of the materials
  already in these pages, devoid of original facts or documents.</p>

    <p>A complete list of the names of all the competitors, together with those selected by the
    Committee, will be found in the Appendix; also a description and views of the two designs
    specially referred to.</p>

    <p>The surface covered by the Basilica of St. Peter's at Rome amounts to 223,900 square feet,
    the Cathedral at Milan occupies 124,100, and St. Paul's, London, 114,900 square feet.</p>

    <p>It is perhaps necessary to mention here, that the leakage of the roof which was at first much
    complained of was owing to incomplete construction, and not to any defect in the principle, or
    in the manner in which it has been carried out.</p>

    <p>About three hundred planks were passed through the machine in a working-day of ten hours,
    allowing the necessary stoppages for sharpening the cutters; and if only three widths of
    sash-bar were produced out of each blank, the quantity finished per diem would amount to about
    two miles and three quarters. This machinery, as well as that for grooving and moulding the
    ridges, was worked at the Phoenix Saw-mills, Cumberland-basin, Regent's Park, belonging to Mr.
    Birch.</p>

    <p>A This piece of machinery is only novel in its application, as it is similar to that used by
    brush-makers for drilling a number of small holes in close and regular arrangement.</p>
